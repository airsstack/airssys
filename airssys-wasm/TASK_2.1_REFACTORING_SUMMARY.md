# WASM-TASK-003 Phase 2 Task 2.1 - Multi-File Refactoring Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ✅ REFACTORING COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Decision:** Multi-file organization for better maintainability

---

## Summary

Successfully refactored the monolithic `core.wit` (414 lines) into 4 well-organized, focused interface files while maintaining the same `airssys:core@1.0.0` package. This improves code organization, maintainability, and Git history clarity without any functional changes.

---

## What Changed

### Before: Single Monolithic File
```
airssys-wasm/wit/core/
├── core.wit           (414 lines - all 4 interfaces)
└── deps.toml
```

### After: Four Focused Files
```
airssys-wasm/wit/core/
├── types.wit                    (112 lines - Layer 0: Foundation types)
├── capabilities.wit             (94 lines - Layer 1: Permissions)
├── component-lifecycle.wit      (141 lines - Layer 2: Lifecycle management)
├── host-services.wit           (123 lines - Layer 3: Host functions)
└── deps.toml
```

**Total:** 470 lines (4 interfaces, same package)

---

## File Breakdown

### 1. **types.wit** (112 lines) - Layer 0: Foundation Types
**Purpose:** Source of truth for all core foundation types

**Contents:**
- `component-id` record (namespace, name, version)

- Easier to find specific types and functions
- Clearer logical separation

### 3. **Enhanced Git History**
- Smaller, focused commits per interface
- Better diffs for code reviews
- Easier to track changes to specific layers

### 4. **IDE Support**
- Better syntax highlighting in smaller files
- Faster navigation and search
- Some editors handle smaller files better

### 5. **Scalability**
- Easier to add new interfaces to package
- Clear pattern for organizing layers
- Extension packages can follow same pattern

### 6. **Team Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different interfaces
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clearer code ownership per layer

## Type Duplication Analysis

### Necessary Duplication (Component Model v0.1 Limitation)
Due to Component Model v0.1 constraints, types are duplicated across interfaces:

| Type | Locations | Count | Size | Reason |
|------|-----------|-------|------|--------|
| `component-id` | types, capabilities, component-lifecycle, host-services | 4 | ~9 lines each | Used by all interfaces |
| `request-id` | types, component-lifecycle, host-services | 3 | 1 line each | Async correlation |
| `component-error` | types, component-lifecycle, host-services | 3 | ~5 lines each | Error handling |
| `execution-error` | types, component-lifecycle | 2 | ~4 lines each | Execution failures |
| `health-status` | types, component-lifecycle | 2 | 5 lines each | Health checks |
| `log-level` | types, host-services | 2 | 5 lines each | Logging severity |
| `timestamp` | types, host-services | 2 | ~3 lines each | Timing |

**Total Duplication:** ~60 lines across 4 files  
**Duplication Percentage:** ~12.8% of total code (acceptable for v0.1 constraint)

---

## Component Model v0.1 Limitation Workaround

**The Problem:**
- Cannot use qualified type references: `types.component-id` ❌
- Cannot use selective imports: `use types.{component-id}` ❌
- Each interface must be self-contained

**The Solution:**
- Multiple focused files in same package ✅
- Necessary type duplication for isolation ✅
- Clear comments linking duplicates to source definitions ✅

**See DEBT-WASM-003 for:**
- Detailed limitation analysis
- Migration path for Component Model v0.2
- Long-term refactoring strategy

---

## Migration Considerations

### Same Package, Different Organization
- **Package Name:** Still `airssys:core@1.0.0` (no breaking changes)
- **Interfaces:** Still 4 interfaces (types, capabilities, component-lifecycle, host-services)
- **Validation:** Still passes wasm-tools validation with exit code 0
- **Functionality:** 100% identical - just reorganized

### No Changes Required To:
- Build system integration
- wit-bindgen configuration
- Phase 3 integration plans
- Extension package implementation
- Dependent code or bindings

---

## Code Organization Quality

### Layered Architecture
```
Layer 0: types.wit
├── Foundation types (component-id, request-id, timestamp)
├── Error types (all operation error variants)
└── Status types (health-status, log-level, execution-status)

Layer 1: capabilities.wit
├── Depends on: types (component-id)
├── Permission types for filesystem, network, process
└── Permission aggregation and validation

Layer 2: component-lifecycle.wit
├── Depends on: types (component-id, request-id, component-error, etc.)
├── Component configuration and execution
├── Lifecycle management contract
└── 7 lifecycle functions

Layer 3: host-services.wit
├── Depends on: types (component-id, request-id, log-level, timestamp)
├── Host-provided services for components
├── Messaging and logging
└── 8 host-provided functions
```

### Clear Dependency Flow
```
types.wit (foundation)
