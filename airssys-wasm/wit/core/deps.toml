# Core WIT Package Dependencies
# 
# This is a standalone core package with no external dependencies.
# It contains all foundation types and interfaces for the AirsSys WASM framework.
#
# Component Model v0.1 Limitation Note:
# Cross-interface type references are not supported in this version of wasm-tools.
# Therefore, types are duplicated across interfaces for proper isolation.
# See DEBT-WASM-003 for migration strategy when Component Model v0.2 is available.
