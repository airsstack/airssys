//! # Security Module
//!
//! Security-related types and logic: capabilities, policies, validation.
//!
//! Security must be independent so it can be applied uniformly
//! across all other layers.

// Module declarations will be added in subsequent tasks
// Following PROJECTS_STANDARD.md §4.3: mod.rs contains only declarations and re-exports
