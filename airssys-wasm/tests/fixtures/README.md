# Test Fixtures

This directory contains WASM component fixtures for integration testing.

## Purpose

Each fixture represents a WASM component used to test specific functionality of airssys-wasm.

## Fixtures

*(Fixtures will be added in subsequent tasks)*

## Documentation

For each fixture, document:
- **What** the fixture does
- **Why** it exists (what it tests)
- **How** it was generated (build commands, source location)

## Fixture Generation

Fixtures should be generated from real WASM components following WIT interface definitions.
