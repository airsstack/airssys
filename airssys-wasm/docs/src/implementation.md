# Implementation

This section documents the implementation details, development guidelines, and practical aspects of building and deploying airssys-wasm components.

## Development Workflow

### Component Development
- **SDK Usage**: Leveraging derive macros and development tools
- **WIT Interface Design**: Creating effective component interfaces
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit, integration, and component testing approaches

### Build and Deployment
- **Component Compilation**: WASM compilation with optimal settings
- **Hot Deployment**: Using zero-downtime deployment strategies
- **Version Management**: Managing component versions and rollbacks

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Components should have focused, well-defined purposes
- **Interface First**: Design WIT interfaces before implementation
- **Capability Minimal**: Request only necessary capabilities

### Performance Optimization
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage patterns in WASM
- **CPU Optimization**: Leveraging Cranelift compiler optimizations
- **I/O Efficiency**: Optimal patterns for resource access

### Security Best Practices
- **Capability Management**: Proper use of capability-based security
- **Input Validation**: Secure handling of component inputs
- **Resource Limits**: Setting appropriate resource boundaries

## Deployment Strategies

### Hot Deployment Options
- **Blue-Green**: Full environment switching for safe deployments
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with traffic splitting
- **Rolling**: Sequential instance updates with load balancing

### Production Considerations
- **Monitoring**: Component health and performance tracking
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and analysis
- **Backup and Recovery**: Version rollback and disaster recovery procedures
