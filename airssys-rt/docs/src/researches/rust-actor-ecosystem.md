# Rust Actor Ecosystem Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current Rust actor ecosystem, examining existing frameworks, their design decisions, and lessons learned that inform `airssys-rt`'s architecture.

## Current Landscape Overview

The Rust ecosystem features several actor frameworks, each taking different approaches to implementing the actor model. This analysis examines their strengths, limitations, and architectural decisions.

## Major Actor Frameworks

### 1. Actix (Mature Production Framework)

**Repository**: `actix/actix`  
**Status**: Mature, widely adopted  
**Foundation**: Built on Tokio

#### Architecture Highlights
```rust
// Actor definition in Actix
use actix::prelude::*;

struct CounterActor {
    count: usize,
}

impl Actor for CounterActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

// Message handling
impl Handler<IncrementMessage> for CounterActor {
    type Result = usize;
    
    fn handle(&mut self, _msg: IncrementMessage, _ctx: &mut Context<Self>) -> Self::Result {
        self.count += 1;
        self.count
    }
}
```

```rust
// Ractor actor definition
use ractor::prelude::*;

struct WorkerActor {
    state: WorkerState,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Actor for WorkerActor {
    type Msg = WorkerMessage;
    type State = WorkerState;
    type Arguments = WorkerConfig;
    
    async fn pre_start(
        &self,
        myself: ActorRef<Self::Msg>,
        args: Self::Arguments,
    ) -> Result<Self::State, ActorProcessingErr> {
        Ok(WorkerState::new(args))
    }
    
    async fn handle(
        &self,
        myself: ActorRef<Self::Msg>,
        message: Self::Msg,
        state: &mut Self::State,
    ) -> Result<(), ActorProcessingErr> {
        // Handle message
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

            msg! {
                msg: String => {
                    // Handle string message
                },
                _: _ => {
                    // Handle unknown message
                },

## Architectural Patterns Analysis

### Scheduling Models

#### Cooperative Scheduling (Most Frameworks)
```rust
// All frameworks rely on async/await cooperative scheduling
async fn actor_loop() {
    loop {
        let message = mailbox.recv().await; // Yield point
        handle_message(message).await;      // Yield point
    }
}
```

**Implications for airssys-rt**:
- Must work within cooperative scheduling constraints
- CPU-bound tasks can starve other actors
- Need strategies for fairness and responsiveness

#### Preemptive Scheduling (None Implemented)
```rust
// No Rust actor framework implements true preemption
// Would require custom runtime or sandboxing (like WASM)
```

**Implications for airssys-rt**:
- True preemption would require significant complexity
- Hybrid approaches may provide benefits
- Consider WebAssembly for isolation and preemption

### Message Passing Patterns

#### Channel-Based (Most Common)
```rust
// Actors communicate via channels
struct ActorRef<M> {
    sender: mpsc::UnboundedSender<M>,
}

impl<M> ActorRef<M> {
    async fn send(&self, msg: M) -> Result<(), SendError> {
        self.sender.send(msg).map_err(|_| SendError::Disconnected)
    }
}
```

#### Shared State (Some Frameworks)
```rust
// Some frameworks allow shared state with careful synchronization
struct SharedActor {
    shared_data: Arc<RwLock<Data>>,
}
```

**Implications for airssys-rt**:
- Channel-based approach is most common and proven
- Shared state patterns can optimize performance in specific cases
- Type safety is crucial for message passing correctness

### Supervision Patterns

#### Library-Level Supervision (Actix, Xactor)
```rust
// Supervision implemented as library pattern
struct Supervisor {
    children: Vec<ActorRef>,
}

impl Supervisor {
    async fn handle_child_failure(&self, child: ActorRef) {
        // Restart logic implemented in userland
    }
}
```

#### Runtime-Integrated Supervision (Ractor, Bastion)
```rust
// Supervision integrated into actor runtime
impl Actor for SupervisorActor {
    async fn handle_child_exit(&mut self, child: ActorId, reason: ExitReason) {
        match self.strategy {
            RestartStrategy::OneForOne => self.restart_child(child).await,
            // Other strategies...
        }
    }
}
```

**Implications for airssys-rt**:
- Runtime-integrated supervision enables better optimization
- Library-level supervision is simpler to implement
- OTP-style supervision requires careful API design
