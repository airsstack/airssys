## Architectural Principles

AirsSys RT architecture follows these core principles:

### 1. Actor Model Foundations

**Encapsulation and Isolation:**
- Actors own their state (no shared mutable state)
- Message passing for all communication
- Location transparency (local and remote actors use same API)

**Sequential Message Processing:**
- One message at a time (no internal concurrency)
- FIFO message ordering guaranteed
- Deterministic message handling

### 2. Erlang/OTP-Inspired Supervision

**"Let it Crash" Philosophy:**
- Simple happy path logic in actors
- Supervisors handle failure recovery
- Clear separation: actors do work, supervisors provide fault tolerance

**Supervision Trees:**
- Hierarchical fault isolation
- Different strategies for different failure scenarios
- Automatic restart with configurable limits

### 3. Zero-Cost Abstractions

**Performance Without Compromise:**
- Generic compilation (monomorphization)
- No runtime type dispatch on hot paths
- Direct memory access (no unnecessary indirection)
- Inline message processing

**Benchmarked Performance:**
- Actor spawn: 624ns (1.6M actors/sec)
- Message passing: 737ns roundtrip (1.36M msgs/sec)
- Supervision overhead: ~2x base actor (acceptable for fault tolerance)

### 4. Type Safety

**Compile-Time Guarantees:**
- Associated types for messages and errors
- Generic constraints for trait bounds
- Type-state pattern (future) for lifecycle validation

**No Runtime Surprises:**
- Explicit error types (`Result<T, E>`)
- No `Any` or type erasure on hot paths
- Clear message protocols with associated `Result` types

### 5. Dependency Injection

**Testability and Flexibility (ADR-006):**
- `MessageBroker` trait injected into `ActorContext`
- Swap implementations (in-memory, distributed, test doubles)
- No global state or singletons

**Benefits:**
- Unit test actors in isolation
- Different brokers for different deployment scenarios
- Clear component boundaries

### Layer Responsibilities

**Application Layer:**
- Business logic implementation
- Actor and supervisor instantiation

- Supervision tree construction
- Restart strategy implementation
- Actor context and metadata

**Messaging Layer:**

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Monitoring and Observability

**Built-in Metrics:**
- Actor message counts
- Supervisor restart counts
- Mailbox depth tracking
- Health check API

**Integration Points:**
- Custom metrics via `ActorContext`
- Supervision events for monitoring
- Health check endpoints

### Error Handling

**Layered Error Strategy:**
- Actor-level: `Result<T, Self::Error>`
- Supervisor-level: `ErrorAction` (Resume, Restart, Stop, Escalate)
- System-level: Supervisor escalation and shutdown

**Error Propagation:**
```
Actor Error → on_error() → ErrorAction → Supervisor → Restart Strategy
```

### Performance Optimization

**Hot Path Optimizations:**
- Inline message processing (31.55ns)
- Direct mailbox access (no indirection)
- Monomorphized generics (no dynamic dispatch)
- Bounded mailboxes for predictable performance

**Cold Path Acceptable Costs:**
- Actor spawn: 624ns (infrequent)
- Supervision overhead: +656ns (fault tolerance worth it)
- Broker routing: +180ns (flexibility worth it)

---

## Deployment Patterns

### Single Process

**Architecture:**
- All actors in one process
- In-memory message passing
- Shared Tokio runtime

**Use Cases:**
- Development and testing
- Single-machine deployments
- Embedded systems

### Distributed (Future)

**Architecture:**
- Actors across multiple processes/machines
- Network-based message passing
- Location transparency maintained

**Use Cases:**
- Horizontal scaling
- Geographic distribution
- High availability

---

## Design Tradeoffs

### Type Safety vs. Flexibility

**Decision:** Favor type safety
- Associated types for messages/errors
- Generic constraints over trait objects
- **Tradeoff:** Less runtime flexibility, more compile-time safety

### Performance vs. Features

**Decision:** Measure first, optimize hot paths
- Benchmarked all core operations
- Zero-cost abstractions on hot paths
- **Tradeoff:** Complexity in implementation, predictable performance

### Simplicity vs. Power

**Decision:** Start simple, add complexity when needed (YAGNI)
- Basic actor model first
- Supervision added incrementally
- **Tradeoff:** May miss some features initially, cleaner codebase
