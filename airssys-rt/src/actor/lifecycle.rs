/// Actor state in the lifecycle state machine.
///
/// Represents the current phase in an actor's lifecycle, from initialization
/// through normal operation to shutdown. Supervisors use these states to make
/// restart decisions and monitor actor health.
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// Normal lifecycle flow:
/// ```text
/// Starting -> Running -> Stopping -> Stopped
/// ```
///
/// With failures and restarts:
/// ```text
/// Starting ──┬──> Running ──┬──> Stopping ──> Stopped
///            │               │
///            ├──> Failed <───┤
///            │       │
///            └───────┘ (supervisor restarts)
/// ```
///
/// # State Descriptions
///
/// - **Starting**: Actor is initializing via `Actor::pre_start()`
/// - **Running**: Actor is actively processing messages via `Actor::handle_message()`
/// - **Stopping**: Actor is shutting down via `Actor::post_stop()`
/// - **Stopped**: Actor has terminated successfully (terminal state)
/// - **Failed**: Actor encountered an error and needs supervision (terminal state)
///
/// # Supervision Integration
///
/// Supervisors monitor actor states to enforce restart policies:
/// - **Failed** state triggers supervisor restart strategies
/// - **restart_count** tracked for maximum restart limits
/// - **last_state_change** used for restart windows and rate limiting
///
/// # Performance
///
/// State transitions are zero-cost (simple enum assignment). State checks
/// are compile-time optimized with no runtime overhead.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_rt::ActorState;
///
/// let state = ActorState::Starting;
/// assert_eq!(state, ActorState::Starting);
/// assert_eq!(ActorState::default(), ActorState::Starting);
/// ```
///
/// Check for terminal states:
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_rt::ActorState;
///
/// fn is_terminal(state: ActorState) -> bool {
///     matches!(state, ActorState::Stopped | ActorState::Failed)
/// }
///
/// assert!(!is_terminal(ActorState::Running));
/// assert!(is_terminal(ActorState::Stopped));
/// assert!(is_terminal(ActorState::Failed));
/// ```

/// Actor lifecycle tracker with state management and supervision support.
///
/// Tracks actor state transitions, restart count, and timing information
/// for supervision, monitoring, and health checks. Each actor maintains
/// its own lifecycle tracker to provide visibility into its operational state.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The lifecycle tracker serves multiple purposes:
/// - **State Management**: Track current actor state (Starting, Running, etc.)
/// - **Restart Tracking**: Count actor restarts for supervision policies
/// - **Timing**: Record state change timestamps for monitoring
/// - **Health Checks**: Determine if actor is running or in terminal state
///
/// # Integration with Supervision
///
/// Supervisors use lifecycle information to enforce restart policies:
///
/// - **restart_count**: Enforce maximum restart limits before giving up
/// - **last_state_change**: Calculate restart rate for restart windows
/// - **state**: Determine if restart is needed (Failed state)
/// - **is_terminal()**: Check if actor can still be restarted
///
/// # Lifecycle Phases
///
/// **1. Starting** (Initialization)
/// - Actor created and `pre_start()` called
/// - Resources allocated, connections established
/// - Transition to Running on success, Failed on error
///
/// **2. Running** (Normal Operation)
/// - Actor processes messages via `handle_message()`
/// - Most of actor's lifetime spent in this state
/// - Can transition to Stopping (graceful) or Failed (error)
///
/// **3. Stopping** (Shutdown)
/// - Actor shutting down via `post_stop()`
/// - Resources released, connections closed
/// - Transitions to Stopped on completion
///
/// **4. Stopped** (Terminal - Success)
/// - Actor terminated successfully
/// - Cannot transition to other states
/// - Cleanup complete
///
/// **5. Failed** (Terminal - Error)
/// - Actor encountered unrecoverable error
/// - Supervisor decides restart or escalation
/// - May transition back to Starting if restarted
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **State transitions**: Zero-cost (enum field assignment + timestamp)
/// - **State queries**: Inlined, compile-time optimized
/// - **restart_count**: Simple u32 increment
/// - **Memory overhead**: ~24 bytes per actor (enum + DateTime + u32)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic lifecycle tracking:
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_rt::{ActorLifecycle, ActorState};
///
/// let mut lifecycle = ActorLifecycle::new();
/// assert_eq!(lifecycle.state(), ActorState::Starting);
///
/// // Actor started successfully
/// lifecycle.transition_to(ActorState::Running);
/// assert_eq!(lifecycle.state(), ActorState::Running);
/// assert_eq!(lifecycle.restart_count(), 0);
/// assert!(lifecycle.is_running());
/// ```
///
/// Tracking restarts:
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_rt::{ActorLifecycle, ActorState};
///
/// let mut lifecycle = ActorLifecycle::new();
/// lifecycle.transition_to(ActorState::Running);
///
/// // Actor failed
/// lifecycle.transition_to(ActorState::Failed);
/// assert!(lifecycle.is_terminal());
///
/// // Supervisor restarts actor
/// lifecycle.transition_to(ActorState::Starting);
/// lifecycle.transition_to(ActorState::Running);
/// assert_eq!(lifecycle.restart_count(), 1);
/// ```
///
/// Health checking:
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_rt::{ActorLifecycle, ActorState};
///
/// fn check_health(lifecycle: &ActorLifecycle) -> &'static str {
///     if lifecycle.is_running() {
///         "healthy"
///     } else if lifecycle.is_terminal() {
///         "terminated"
///     } else {
///         "transitioning"
///     }

/// let mut lifecycle = ActorLifecycle::new();
/// assert_eq!(check_health(&lifecycle), "transitioning");
