//! Security policy framework and evaluation engine.

//! This module provides the core security policy abstraction and policy
//! evaluation framework for the security middleware.

/// Core trait for security policy implementations.
///
/// Security policies evaluate operations against security rules and return
/// a decision on whether the operation should be allowed, denied, or require
/// additional authentication.
///
/// # Design Philosophy
///
/// This trait uses `SecurityContext` exclusively for policy evaluation.
/// All resource information (file paths, network endpoints, etc.) should
/// be passed through `SecurityContext.attributes` by middleware before
/// policy evaluation.
///
/// # Design Principles
///
/// - **Simple design** (ยง6.1 YAGNI, ยง6.2): No generic parameters, straightforward evaluation
/// - **Deny-by-default**: Policies should deny unless explicitly allowed
/// - **Stateless evaluation**: Policy evaluation should be deterministic
/// - **Clear decisions**: Return explicit Allow/Deny with reasons
/// - **Context-driven**: All information flows through SecurityContext for maximum flexibility
///
/// # Example Implementation
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_osl::middleware::security::policy::{
///     SecurityPolicy, PolicyDecision, PolicyScope
/// };
/// use airssys_osl::core::context::SecurityContext;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct AdminOnlyPolicy;
///
/// impl SecurityPolicy for AdminOnlyPolicy {
///     fn evaluate(&self, context: &SecurityContext) -> PolicyDecision {
///         if context.is_admin() {
///             PolicyDecision::Allow
///         } else {
///             PolicyDecision::Deny("Admin privileges required".to_string())
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn description(&self) -> &str {
///         "Admin-only access policy"
///     }
///
///     fn scope(&self) -> PolicyScope {
///         PolicyScope::All
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be thread-safe (Send + Sync) as policies may be
/// evaluated concurrently from multiple threads.
pub trait SecurityPolicy: Debug + Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Evaluate if the operation is permitted based on security context.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `context` - The security context containing principal, session, and attributes
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns a `PolicyDecision` indicating whether the operation should
    /// be allowed, denied, or requires additional authentication.
    ///
    /// # Context Attributes
    ///
    /// Policies can access operation details through `context.attributes`:
    /// - `resource_type`: Type of resource (e.g., "file", "network", "process")
    /// - `resource_path`: Resource identifier (e.g., file path, URL)
    /// - `action`: Operation action (e.g., "read", "write", "execute")
    /// - Custom attributes: Application-specific context
