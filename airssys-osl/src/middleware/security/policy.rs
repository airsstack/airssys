//! This module provides the core security policy abstraction and policy

/// Security policies evaluate operations against security rules and return
/// a decision on whether the operation should be allowed, denied, or require

///
/// # Generic Parameters
///
/// * `O` - The operation type this policy can evaluate
///
/// # Design Principles
///
/// - **Generic-first design** (ยง6.2): Uses generic constraints for type safety
/// - **Deny-by-default**: Policies should deny unless explicitly allowed
/// - **Stateless evaluation**: Policy evaluation should be deterministic
/// - **Clear decisions**: Return explicit Allow/Deny with reasons
///
/// # Example Implementation
///
/// ```rust
/// use airssys_osl::middleware::security::policy::{
///     SecurityPolicy, PolicyDecision, PolicyScope
/// };
/// use airssys_osl::core::{context::SecurityContext, operation::Operation};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct AlwaysAllowPolicy;
///
/// impl<O: Operation> SecurityPolicy<O> for AlwaysAllowPolicy {
///     fn evaluate(&self, _operation: &O, _context: &SecurityContext) -> PolicyDecision {
///         PolicyDecision::Allow
///     }
///
///     fn description(&self) -> &str {
///         "Always allow policy (for testing only)"
///     }
///
///     fn scope(&self) -> PolicyScope {
///         PolicyScope::All
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be thread-safe (Send + Sync) as policies may be
/// evaluated concurrently from multiple threads.
