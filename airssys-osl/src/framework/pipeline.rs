//! Middleware pipeline orchestration.
//!
//! This module provides the middleware pipeline that orchestrates the execution
//! of middleware in the proper order with comprehensive error handling and
//! lifecycle management.
//!
//! # Phase 1 Note
//!
//! This is a foundational implementation. Full pipeline execution with middleware
//! orchestration will be implemented in Phase 2 after resolving Operation trait
//! object-safety challenges (removing Clone constraint or using wrapper types).

/// Pipeline for orchestrating middleware execution.
///
/// `MiddlewarePipeline` manages the execution of middleware in the proper order,
/// handling errors, and ensuring proper lifecycle management.
///
/// # Phase 1 Implementation
///
/// Phase 1 provides the foundational structure. Full middleware orchestration
/// requires making the Operation trait object-safe, which will be addressed
/// in Phase 2 by either:
/// 1. Removing the Clone bound from Operation trait
/// 2. Using a wrapper type for dynamic dispatch
/// 3. Using a different architecture pattern
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// The pipeline executes middleware in three phases:
/// 1. **Before execution**: All middleware `before_execution` methods are called
/// 2. **Execute**: The operation is executed by the appropriate executor
/// 3. **After execution**: All middleware `after_execution` methods are called in reverse
