//! Operation builders for framework ergonomic APIs.
//!
//! This module contains placeholder operation builders that will be fully
//! implemented in OSL-TASK-006. These provide the fluent interfaces for
//! constructing and executing operations through the framework.

/// Full implementation coming in OSL-TASK-006.

/// Placeholder for network operations builder.

// TODO: The following components will be completed in OSL-TASK-006:
// - Full implementation of operation builders with fluent APIs
// - Execute methods for each builder type
// - Integration with middleware pipeline
// - Automatic security context propagation
