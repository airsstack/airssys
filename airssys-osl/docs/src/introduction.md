# Introduction

Welcome to **AirsSys OSL** (OS Layer Framework), a secure foundation for system programming that addresses the critical challenges of modern operating system interaction.

## Problem Statement

Modern system programming requires direct interaction with operating system primitives, but this comes with significant risks:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Direct OS calls can expose applications to security threats
- **Platform Inconsistencies**: Different operating systems provide different APIs and behaviors  
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: Most OS operations lack comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Error-Prone Operations**: Low-level system programming is susceptible to memory safety and resource management errors
- **Complexity Overhead**: Applications must implement security, logging, and cross-platform compatibility repeatedly

## Solution Approach

AirsSys OSL addresses these challenges by providing a secure, cross-platform, and well-instrumented abstraction layer over operating system functionality. It enables applications to perform system-level operations safely while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and enforcing security policies.

## Target Use Cases

### Secure Application Development
- Applications requiring file system operations with security guarantees
- Network services needing controlled access to system resources
- Process management with audit trails and security policies
- External tool integration with sandboxing and monitoring

### AirsStack Ecosystem Integration
- Foundation layer for airssys-rt actor system process management
- Security primitives for airssys-wasm component sandboxing
- Comprehensive logging for ecosystem-wide security monitoring
- Standardized resource management across all AirsStack components

### Enterprise System Administration
- Automated system management with comprehensive audit trails
- Secure script execution with policy enforcement
- Resource monitoring and management
- Integration with enterprise security and monitoring systems

## User Experience Goals

### Developer Experience
- **Simple API**: Intuitive interfaces that abstract OS complexity
- **Safety by Default**: Secure defaults that prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear examples and usage patterns
- **Excellent Error Messages**: Detailed, actionable error information
- **Performance Transparency**: Clear understanding of performance characteristics

### Operations Experience
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed activity logs for all system operations
- **Policy Configuration**: Flexible security policy configuration
- **Monitoring Integration**: Easy integration with existing monitoring systems
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Rich diagnostic information for issue resolution
- **Compliance Support**: Audit trails meeting enterprise compliance requirements

## Quick Start

*Note: AirsSys OSL is currently in foundation setup phase. The API shown below represents the planned interface.*

### Installation

Add AirsSys OSL to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
airssys-osl = "0.1.0"
```

### Basic Usage Pattern

```rust
use airssys_osl::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> OSResult<()> {
    // This represents the planned API - implementation in progress
    let osl = OSLFramework::builder()
        .with_security_logging(true)
        .build().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Current Status

**Phase**: Foundation Setup and Architecture Design  
**Status**: Memory bank and documentation framework completed, core implementation in progress
