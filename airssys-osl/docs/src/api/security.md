# Security Framework

*This section will document the consolidated security middleware once implementation begins.*

## Current Status
**Implementation Phase**: Planning  
**Module Location**: `middleware/security/` (consolidated approach)  
**Documentation Source**: Memory bank security architecture

Based on the documented security-consolidated architecture:

## Security Integration Pattern
- All security concerns handled within security middleware
- No separate `SecurityPolicy` trait - integrated into `SecurityMiddleware`
- Security middleware processes all operations before execution

## Planned Structure
```
middleware/security/
├── mod.rs          # Security middleware exports and orchestration
├── policy.rs       # Policy evaluation (replaces separate SecurityPolicy trait)
├── acl.rs          # Access Control Lists implementation
├── rbac.rs         # Role-Based Access Control implementation
└── audit.rs        # Security audit logging
```

## Security Principles
Based on documented requirements:
- **Deny by default**: All operations require explicit permission
- **Comprehensive auditing**: All system operations logged
- **Policy enforcement**: Runtime security policy validation
- **Threat detection**: Built-in detection of suspicious activities

This section will be updated with detailed security API documentation once the middleware implementation is completed.
