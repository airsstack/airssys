## Active ADRs

### ADR-WASM-001: Multicodec Compatibility Strategy
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Category:** Serialization & Interoperability

### ADR-WASM-010: Implementation Strategy and Build Order
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-20
- **Category:** Implementation Planning & Architecture
- **Summary:** 4-layer phased implementation strategy with Actor System Integration as foundational component (Layer 1, Block 3), NOT an integration layer component. Defines 11 major building blocks with correct dependency order, preventing circular dependencies and architectural rework. Critical correction: airssys-rt integration must come early as foundation (Block 3) because Inter-Component Communication (Block 5) and Component Lifecycle (Block 7) depend on MessageBroker and SupervisorNode.
- **Related:** All ADRs (implementation guidance), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-001 (Component Framework), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-005 (Messaging), ADR-WASM-006 (Actor Isolation), ADR-WASM-009 (MessageBroker dependency)

- **Summary:** Hybrid block-aligned module structure combining flat domain-driven organization (airssys-rt pattern) with core abstraction layer (airssys-osl pattern). Direct 1:1 mapping to 11 implementation blocks, core/ module prevents circular dependencies, prelude re-exports for ergonomic API, mod.rs declaration-only following workspace §4.3.
- **Related:** ADR-WASM-010 (Implementation Strategy), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-012 (Module Structure Architecture), Workspace §4.3 (Module Architecture), §2.1 (Imports), §6.1 (YAGNI)
- **Impact:** Critical - Defines entire crate organization and code structure for all implementations
- **File:** `adr_wasm_011_module_structure_organization.md`

### ADR-WASM-012: Comprehensive Core Abstractions Strategy
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-21
- **Category:** Architecture & Type System Design
- **Summary:** Comprehensive core abstractions covering ALL implementation blocks (1-11). Core module contains universal types (component, capability, error, config) PLUS domain-specific abstractions for each block (runtime, interface, actor, security, messaging, storage, lifecycle, management, bridge, observability). Trait-centric design with zero internal dependencies.
- **Related:** ADR-WASM-011 (Module Structure), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-012 (Module Architecture), WASM-TASK-000 (Core Design)
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Prevents circular dependencies, enables parallel development, ensures API stability
- **File:** `adr_wasm_012_comprehensive_core_abstractions_strategy.md`

### ADR-WASM-013: StorageTransaction Removal (YAGNI Simplification)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-22
- **Category:** Storage Architecture Simplification
- **Summary:** Remove unused StorageTransaction trait from storage.rs per YAGNI principle. Actor model sequential processing eliminates need for transactions. Aligns with ADR-WASM-007 Decision 5 rationale. Simplifies API surface, reduces maintenance burden, eliminates Box<dyn> pattern complexity.
- **Related:** ADR-WASM-007 (Storage Backend Selection, Decision 5), ADR-WASM-006 (Actor Isolation), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-007 (Component Storage)
- **Impact:** Low - Removes unused abstraction with zero usage across codebase
- **File:** `adr_wasm_013_storage_transaction_removal.md`

### ADR-WASM-014: RoutingStrategy Removal (YAGNI Simplification)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-22
- **Category:** Messaging Architecture Simplification
- **Summary:** Remove unused RoutingStrategy trait from messaging.rs per YAGNI principle. Routing handled exclusively by airssys-rt MessageBroker per ADR-WASM-009 architecture. No pluggable routing strategies in design. Simplifies API surface, removes fictional documentation, eliminates Box<dyn> pattern complexity.
- **Related:** ADR-WASM-009 (Component Communication Model), ADR-WASM-006 (Actor Isolation), ADR-WASM-005 (Security Model), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-005 (Messaging Architecture)
- **Impact:** Low - Removes unused abstraction with zero usage across codebase
- **File:** `adr_wasm_014_routing_strategy_removal.md`

### ADR-WASM-015: WIT Package Structure Organization
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-25
- **Category:** Interface Design & Organization
- **Summary:** Adopt directory-based package structure with semantic naming following pattern `airssys:{directory}-{type}@{version}`. Resolves discrepancy between WASM-TASK-003 Phase 1 plan (6 separate WIT files) and delivery (2 consolidated packages). Establishes 7-package structure: 4 core packages (types, component, capabilities, host) and 3 extension packages (filesystem, network, process).
- **Related:** WASM-TASK-003 Phase 1, ADR-WASM-011 (Module Structure), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-004 (WIT Management)
- **Impact:** High - Defines definitive WIT package organization, resolves structural inconsistency, enables proper Phase 2 continuation
- **File:** `adr_wasm_015_wit_package_structure_organization.md`

### ADR-WASM-018: Three-Layer Architecture and Boundary Definitions ⭐ NEW
- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Date:** 2025-12-14
- **Category:** Architecture & Integration Design
- **Summary:** Explicit three-layer architecture with clear ownership boundaries: Layer 1 (WASM Component Configuration & Tracking), Layer 2 (WASM Component Lifecycle & Spawning), Layer 3 (Actor System Runtime - airssys-rt). Eliminates architectural confusion regarding actor system ownership, component definition, and feature implementation location. Prevents duplicate supervision logic, confirms airssys-wasm uses airssys-rt (not replacement), and codifies "component = WASM binary + dedicated actor" definition.
- **Related:** ADR-WASM-006 (Component Isolation), ADR-RT-004 (Actor/Child Separation), ADR-WASM-001 (Multicodec), KNOWLEDGE-WASM-018 (Component Definitions - Detailed Reference)
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Architectural foundation for all Phase 3+ development, prevents major design errors
- **Key Decisions:**
  - Layer 1: SupervisorConfig, BackoffStrategy, ComponentSupervisor (WASM-specific)
  - Layer 2: ComponentActor, ComponentSpawner, ComponentRegistry, WasmRuntime (Component lifecycle)
  - Layer 3: ActorSystem, SupervisorNode, MessageBroker, Mailbox (Actor system - airssys-rt provides)
  - One-way dependency: Layer 2 → Layer 3 (airssys-wasm uses airssys-rt)
  - Component definition: ComponentActor (Actor + Child traits) wrapping loaded WASM binary
  - Explicit non-ownership: airssys-wasm does NOT own actor system, mailbox, message broker, or supervision strategies
- **Rationale:** Clarifies architecture after Phase 2 integration work revealed potential confusion points. Provides unambiguous reference for future developers.

## ADR-WASM-019: Runtime Dependency Management

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Context:** Phase 5 Task 5.1 (Correlation Tracking) implementation review

**Decision:** Adopt multi-layer runtime dependency strategy:
- **Layer 0 (Tokio):** Direct usage for async primitives (channels, timers, tasks)
- **Layer 3 (airssys-rt):** Indirect usage for actor infrastructure (message routing, supervision)
- **Layer 2 (airssys-wasm):** WASM-specific features implementation

**Rationale:**
- Performance: Zero abstraction overhead with direct Tokio usage
- Reusability: Keeps airssys-rt generic (WASM-agnostic)
- Maintainability: Clear layer boundaries
- Flexibility: Full control over async behavior
- Standards: Industry-standard patterns

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Optimal performance (<50ns lookup, <5ms timeout)
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ airssys-rt remains reusable
- ⚠️ Developers need to understand layer boundaries
- ⚠️ Direct Tokio dependency (but already required)

**Implementation:**
- Use Tokio directly for: channels, timers, task spawning, synchronization
- Use airssys-rt indirectly for: message routing, actor lifecycle, supervision
- Implement in Layer 2: WASM-specific features (correlation tracking, permissions)

**Related ADRs:**
- ADR-WASM-018 (Three-Layer Architecture)
- ADR-WASM-009 (Component Communication Model)

## ADR-WASM-020: Message Delivery Ownership Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Category:** Communication Architecture / Message Routing

**Decision:** `ActorSystemSubscriber` owns message delivery. `ComponentRegistry` stays pure (identity lookup only).

**Context:** WASM-TASK-006 Task 1.1 revealed that `route_message_to_subscribers()` was stubbed because `ActorAddress` is an identifier, not a sender. The architectural question was where to store `MailboxSender` for actual message delivery.

**Options Considered:**
1. **Extend ComponentRegistry** (REJECTED) - Violates single responsibility, mixes concerns
2. **Create MailboxRegistry** (CONSIDERED) - Adds unnecessary complexity
3. **ActorSystemSubscriber owns mailbox_senders** (ACCEPTED) - Best alignment with ADR-WASM-009/018

**Key Design:**
```
ComponentRegistry (UNCHANGED)
    └── ComponentId → ActorAddress (identity only)

ActorSystemSubscriber (ENHANCED)
    └── mailbox_senders: HashMap<ComponentId, MailboxSender>
    └── register_mailbox() / unregister_mailbox()
    └── route_message_to_subscribers() → uses mailbox_senders for delivery
```

**Rationale:**
- Single Responsibility: Registry = identity, Subscriber = delivery
- ADR-WASM-009 Alignment: Subscriber handles routing AND delivery
- ADR-WASM-018 Compliance: Clear layer boundaries maintained
- No changes to existing ComponentRegistry API
