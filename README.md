# AirsSys - System Programming Components for AirsStack

`AirsSys` is a collection of system programming components designed to facilitate the development of applications within the AirsStack ecosystem. It provides essential tools and libraries for managing system resources, handling low-level operations, and ensuring efficient performance.

`Airssys` is one of the `airsstack` projects, which is designed to manage the OS system programming, `Erlang Actor Model` runtime system, and pluggable system.

This project will contains three important components:

- `airssys-osl`
- `airssys-rt`
- `airssys-wasm`

## airssys-osl (OS Layer Framework)

This component will handle all low-level OS system programming, enhanced with activity logs and robust security policies.

This component will handle these important and common system activities:

- Filesystem management
- Process management
- Network management
- Utils management
    - Something like calling other programs such as: `docker`, or `gh (github cli)`

## airssys-rt (Runtime)

This component will provide a model of the `Erlang-Actor` system. This component will provide a supervisor for its process management, which follows the `BEAM` approaches.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The `airssys-rt` component is not intended to replace the `BEAM` runtime system. This component will just take the `Erlang-Actor` model as a reference to build its own actor model system and its process management. This component will provide a lightweight actor model system, which can be used to manage high-concurrent applications.

Principles:

- **Encapsulation:** An actor maintains its own private, internal state that cannot be directly accessed or modified by any other actor.
- **Asynchronous Message Passing:** Actors communicate exclusively by sending and receiving immutable messages asynchronously. There is no shared memory, which eliminates the need for complex and error-prone synchronization mechanisms like locks, thereby preventing race conditions by design.
- **Mailbox and Sequential Processing:** Each actor has a "mailbox" that queues incoming messages. The actor processes these messages one at a time, in a sequential manner, ensuring that its internal state is always consistent.

## airssys-wasm (WASM Pluggable System)

This component will provide a WebAssembly (WASM) runtime environment, enabling the execution of WASM modules within the AirsStack ecosystem. It will include features such as:

- A lightweight WASM VM for executing WASM binaries
- Integration with the AirsSys components for seamless communication
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous execution models
- Security features to sandbox WASM modules and restrict their access to system resources

Previously, I have had thoughts related to the "isolated processes", which relate to the `cgroups` and `namespace`; unfortunately, these features are only available in Linux OS environments. These limitations made me think about avoiding these kinds of approaches.

Related with the `WASM` approach, I have found that `WASM` can be a good alternative to the "isolated processes" approach. `WASM` can provide a secure and efficient way to run code in a sandboxed environment, which can be beneficial for certain use cases.

Taken from my researches:

> [!NOTE]

> Today, the industry stands at the cusp of another architectural evolution, moving towards a model that promises even finer-grained modularity, unparalleled portability, and security by default. This new paradigm is centered on the WebAssembly (WASM) Component Model, a technology that reimagines software composition. It envisions applications built not from large, loosely coupled services, but from small, secure, and language-agnostic components that can be seamlessly composed like Lego bricks.

By providing WASM management, especially to build pluggable systems based on a host-guest system. Besides, by following WASM, it already runs inside a sandboxed environment with a deny-by-default security policy, meaning that using WASM it already solve my previous thoughts about "isolated processes".
