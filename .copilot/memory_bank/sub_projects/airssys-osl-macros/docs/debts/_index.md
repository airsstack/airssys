## Resolved Debts

None yet.

## Debt Management Strategy

As a new project, we aim to minimize technical debt through:
1. Following workspace standards strictly from day one
2. Comprehensive testing before declaring features complete
3. Clear documentation concurrent with implementation
4. Regular code reviews and refactoring

## Debt Template

Use template from: `/Users/hiraq/Projects/airsstack/airssys/.copilot/memory_bank/templates/docs/technical-debt-template.md`
