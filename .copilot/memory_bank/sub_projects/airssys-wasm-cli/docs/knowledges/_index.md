### KNOWLEDGE-CLI-001: CLI Implementation Foundation

**File:** `knowledge_cli_001_implementation_foundation.md`  
**Created:** 2025-10-18  
**Status:** Foundation Complete  
**Category:** Implementation Guide

**Summary:**
Foundational implementation knowledge for airssys-wasm-cli, establishing patterns, decisions, and best practices for the CLI tool development. Covers architecture foundations, command implementation patterns, security, testing, and integration with airssys-wasm core library.

**Key Topics:**
- CLI framework selection (clap 4.5 with derive macros)
- Module naming conflict resolution (config â†’ cli_config)
- Error handling architecture (CliError enum with thiserror)
- UX utilities foundation (colored output, progress indicators)
- Configuration management (TOML-based with serde)
- Command stub pattern and implementation readiness
- Integration strategy with airssys-wasm
- Ed25519 signing integration
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Build and distribution configuration
- Performance considerations and targets
- Decision log (ADR-CLI-001 through ADR-CLI-005)

## Knowledge Management

### Document Lifecycle

**Creation Triggers:**
- Major feature implementation
- Architectural pattern discovery
- Integration challenges resolved
- Performance optimization insights
- Security implementation details

**Review Schedule:**
- After each phase completion
- When airssys-wasm core library updates
- After security audits
- Before major releases

**Archive Criteria:**
