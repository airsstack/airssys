# Active Context: airssys-wasm-cli

**Sub-Project:** airssys-wasm-cli  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18  
**Current Phase:** Foundation Setup Complete  
**Status:** 10% Complete - Ready for Command Implementation

---

## Current Focus

### Immediate Priorities

**Foundation Complete ✅:**
- [x] Workspace member setup
- [x] All 14 command stubs
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Configuration management
- [x] UX utilities
- [x] Zero warnings/errors
- [x] Memory bank documentation

**Next Implementation (Q1 2026):**
1. **keygen command** - Ed25519 keypair generation
2. **init command** - Project scaffolding with templates
3. **build command** - Language-agnostic WASM building
4. **sign command** - Component signing
5. **install command** - Multi-source installation

---

## Active Development

### Current Branch
- `main` - Foundation complete, ready for feature development

### Recent Changes (2025-10-18)
- Created complete CLI project structure
- Implemented all 14 command stubs
- Set up error handling and utilities
- Fixed all compiler warnings
- Added workspace dependencies
- Created memory bank documentation

### Blocked Items
None - Ready for implementation work

---

## Integration Status

### Dependencies

**Core Library (airssys-wasm):**
- Status: In architecture phase (15% complete)
- Impact: CLI implementation blocked until core library APIs available
- Timeline: Q1-Q2 2026

**Workspace Integration:**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- All dependencies properly configured
- Follows workspace standards

### Testing Status

- Unit tests: Not yet implemented
- Integration tests: Not yet implemented
- CLI tests: Not yet implemented
- Coverage target: >90%

---

## Technical Debt

None identified yet - foundation is clean

---

## Known Issues

None - zero compilation errors and warnings

---

## Decision Points

### Pending Decisions

1. **Template System** - Which template engine for `init` command?
   - Options: handlebars, tera, minijinja
   - Impact: Project scaffolding flexibility

2. **Build Orchestration** - How to detect and invoke language toolchains?
   - Options: Detect from manifest, scan project files, user specification
   - Impact: `build` command usability

3. **Progress UI** - Terminal vs structured output for long operations
   - Options: Always show progress, respect --quiet flag, detect TTY
   - Impact: User experience and scriptability

### Recent Decisions

1. **Module Naming** - Renamed `config.rs` to `cli_config.rs`
   - Reason: Avoid conflict with `commands::config`
   - Date: 2025-10-18

---

## Next Steps

1. Wait for airssys-wasm core library implementation
2. Design and implement keygen command
3. Create project templates for init command
4. Implement build command with language detection
5. Add comprehensive testing
