# airssys-wasm Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Architecture Design & Strategic Planning  
**Status:** Revolutionary framework architecture complete - ready for implementation  
**Priority:** High - Infrastructure-level innovation that could define industry standards

## Strategic Vision (Updated 2025-09-30)
**airssys-wasm** is positioned as a **Universal Hot-Deployable WASM Component Framework** - the "CosmWasm for everything." This represents infrastructure-level innovation that creates a completely new category of software architecture.

## Recent Major Developments
### 2025-09-30 - Strategic Architecture Breakthrough
- **Vision Refinement**: Evolved from simple WASM runtime to universal component framework
- **Hot Deployment Discovery**: Smart contract-style deployment without restart identified as killer feature
- **Architecture Completion**: Complete framework architecture designed and documented
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Full implementation plan saved with comprehensive documentation

### Key Strategic Insights
- **Universal Framework**: Not limited to AI/MCP - works for any domain (web, IoT, gaming, etc.)
- **Smart Contract Paradigm**: Hot deployment, versioning, rollback like blockchain systems
- **Infrastructure Platform**: Building the foundation others use vs. solving specific problems
- **Competitive Differentiation**: No existing solution combines WASM + hot deployment + composition

## Current Work Items
1. **Documentation Expansion**: Update README and mdBook docs with new strategic vision
2. **Architecture Validation**: Review and refine framework design patterns
3. **Integration Planning**: Detailed AirsSys ecosystem integration strategy
4. **Example Development**: Reference implementations across multiple domains

## Next Steps (When Prerequisites Ready)
1. **Core Runtime Implementation**: Wasmtime integration with Component Model
2. **Hot Deployment Engine**: Zero-downtime deployment system
3. **Capability Security**: Fine-grained permission and access control
4. **Developer SDK**: Rich tooling for component development

## Architectural Decisions Made
- **Framework Approach**: Universal component framework vs. domain-specific solution
- **Hot Deployment**: Smart contract-style deployment as core differentiator  
- **Technology Stack**: Wasmtime, Component Model, WIT, WASI Preview 2
- **Project Structure**: Simplified workspace integration (core/, sdk/, runtime/)
- **Security Model**: Capability-based access control with deny-by-default

## Revolutionary Aspects
1. **Industry First**: No existing universal hot-deployable component framework
2. **Paradigm Shift**: Smart contract deployment model for general computing
3. **Category Creation**: Defining new software architecture category
4. **Ecosystem Platform**: Foundation for next-generation software development

## Dependencies & Timeline
- **airssys-osl Foundation**: Requires mature OS layer for secure system access
- **airssys-rt Foundation**: Requires actor system for component hosting
- **Implementation Start**: 2026 Q1 when dependencies are ready
- **Framework Completion**: 2026 Q3-Q4 with full ecosystem features

## Context for Future Sessions
- Complete architectural framework designed and documented
- Strategic positioning as infrastructure platform established
- Revolutionary vision validated and scoped for maximum impact
- Ready for implementation when foundational dependencies are available
- Documentation expansion needed to communicate strategic vision

## Research Insights
- WebAssembly Component Model provides excellent composition primitives
- Capability-based security aligns well with WASM's sandboxing model
- Integration with actor systems enables powerful component hosting patterns
- WASI provides good system interface foundation but needs AirsSys-specific extensions

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project scope and architecture well-defined
- âœ… Security model research completed
- âœ… Integration strategy with AirsSys components planned
- ðŸ”„ Ready for detailed implementation when foundation components are available
