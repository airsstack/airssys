# airssys-wasm Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Future Planning and Research  
**Status:** Pending - Requires airssys-osl and airssys-rt foundation  
**Priority:** Medium - Advanced component for ecosystem completion

## Recent Changes
### 2025-09-27
- **Memory Bank Established**: Complete project documentation structure
- **WASM Research**: WebAssembly Component Model and WASI analysis
- **Security Model Research**: Capability-based security and sandboxing approaches
- **Integration Strategy**: Planned integration with airssys-osl and airssys-rt

## Current Work Items
1. **Architecture Research**: WASM runtime selection and component model implementation
2. **Security Design**: Capability-based security and sandboxing architecture
3. **Integration Planning**: Deep integration patterns with other AirsSys components
4. **Component Model**: WebAssembly Component Model implementation strategy

## Next Steps (When Prerequisites Ready)
1. **Technology Selection**: Choose WASM runtime (wasmtime vs wasmer vs custom)
2. **Security Framework**: Design capability-based security system
3. **Component Model Implementation**: Implement WebAssembly Component Model support
4. **WASI Implementation**: Implement WASI preview 2 for system interface

## Decisions Made
- **Component Model Focus**: WebAssembly Component Model as primary architecture
- **Security First**: Deny-by-default security with capability-based access
- **AirsSys Integration**: Deep integration with airssys-osl and airssys-rt
- **Polyglot Support**: Support for all WASM-compatible languages

## Pending Decisions
- **WASM Runtime Selection**: wasmtime vs wasmer vs other runtime engines
- **Component Registry**: Component discovery and management approach
- **Host Functions**: Custom host function design for AirsSys integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Specific performance optimization strategies

## Dependencies
- **airssys-osl Completion**: Requires mature OS layer for secure system access
- **airssys-rt Foundation**: Requires actor system for component hosting
- **WASM Ecosystem**: Stable WebAssembly Component Model tooling
- **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security policy and enforcement system

## Context for Future Sessions
- WASM technology research complete with clear direction
- Security model designed around capability-based access control
- Integration architecture planned with other AirsSys components
- Ready for technology selection and initial implementation when dependencies are available

## Research Insights
- WebAssembly Component Model provides excellent composition primitives
- Capability-based security aligns well with WASM's sandboxing model
- Integration with actor systems enables powerful component hosting patterns
- WASI provides good system interface foundation but needs AirsSys-specific extensions

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project scope and architecture well-defined
- âœ… Security model research completed
- âœ… Integration strategy with AirsSys components planned
- ðŸ”„ Ready for detailed implementation when foundation components are available
