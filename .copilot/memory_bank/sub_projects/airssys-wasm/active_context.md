# airssys-wasm Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Core Abstractions Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Status:** âœ… WASM-TASK-000 COMPLETE (100% - All 12 phases)

### 2025-09-30 - Strategic Architecture Completion

- **Runtime Deployment**: Smart contract-inspired deployment patterns without restart as key feature
- **Architecture Completion**: Complete framework architecture designed and documented
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Full implementation plan saved with comprehensive documentation

### Key Strategic Insights
- **General-Purpose Framework**: Not domain-limited - supports AI, web services, IoT, gaming, etc.
- **Runtime Deployment Model**: Component loading, versioning, rollback inspired by blockchain patterns
- **Infrastructure Platform**: Foundation for component-based architectures
- **Key Differentiator**: WASM + runtime deployment + composition in single framework

## Current Work Items
1. **âœ… WASM-TASK-000 Complete**: All 12 phases finished - Core abstractions foundation ready
2. **Strategic Decision Required**: Choose between WASM-TASK-001 (Planning) vs WASM-TASK-002 (Direct Implementation)
3. **Block 1 Ready**: Component Loading & Instantiation validated as 100% ready to start

## Next Steps
**STRATEGIC DECISION REQUIRED:**

**Option A: WASM-TASK-001 - Implementation Planning Task**
- Create comprehensive roadmap for Blocks 1-11
- Map dependencies and implementation sequencing  
- Estimate effort and create timeline
- **Consideration**: May be redundant given Phase 12 validation already provides complete block readiness assessment

**Option B: WASM-TASK-002 - Block 1 Direct Implementation (RECOMMENDED)**
- Start Component Loading & Instantiation implementation
- Validate core abstractions through immediate usage
- Leverage Phase 12 validation showing 100% block readiness
- **Rationale**: Planning overhead may not be justified given comprehensive Phase 12 validation already completed

**Recommendation**: Option B (Direct Implementation) because:
1. Phase 12 already provides complete block readiness assessment
2. All abstractions validated and documented
3. Implementation will immediately validate architectural decisions
4. Block 1 assessed as 100% ready with clear requirements

## Architectural Decisions Made
- **Framework Approach**: General-purpose component framework vs. domain-specific solution
- **Runtime Deployment**: Smart contract-inspired deployment as core feature
- **Technology Stack**: Wasmtime, Component Model, WIT, WASI Preview 2
- **Project Structure**: Simplified workspace integration (core/, sdk/, runtime/)
- **Security Model**: Capability-based access control with deny-by-default

## Key Technical Aspects
1. **Novel Approach**: Combines WASM + runtime deployment + composition
2. **Deployment Model**: Runtime component management inspired by smart contract systems
3. **Infrastructure Platform**: Foundation for component-based software architectures
4. **Cross-Platform**: Provides isolation primitives across different operating systems

## Dependencies & Timeline
- **airssys-osl Foundation**: Requires mature OS layer for secure system access
- **airssys-rt Foundation**: Requires actor system for component hosting
- **Implementation Start**: 2026 Q1 when dependencies are ready
- **Framework Completion**: 2026 Q3-Q4 with full ecosystem features

## Context for Future Sessions
- âœ… **WASM-TASK-000 COMPLETE**: Core abstractions foundation 100% complete
- Complete architectural framework designed and documented  
- Strategic positioning as infrastructure platform established
- Foundation validated and scoped for maximum impact
- **Critical Achievement**: 9,283 lines of code, 363 tests passing, zero warnings, 100% block readiness
- **Quality Metrics**: Zero technical debt except strategic YAGNI deferrals (DEBT-WASM-001, DEBT-WASM-002)
- **Next Phase**: Strategic decision between planning task vs direct Block 1 implementation
- **Ready State**: All 11 implementation blocks validated as 100% ready to proceed
- **Reference**: Phase 12 validation report provides complete foundation assessment

## Research Insights
- WebAssembly Component Model provides excellent composition primitives
- Capability-based security aligns well with WASM's sandboxing model
- Integration with actor systems enables powerful component hosting patterns
- WASI provides good system interface foundation but needs AirsSys-specific extensions

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project scope and architecture well-defined
- âœ… Security model research completed
- âœ… Integration strategy with AirsSys components planned
