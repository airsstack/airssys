# airssys-wasm Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Architecture Design & Strategic Planning  
**Status:** Revolutionary framework architecture complete - ready for implementation  
**Priority:** High - Infrastructure-level innovation that could define industry standards

## Strategic Vision (Updated 2025-10-17)
**airssys-wasm** is a **WASM Component Framework for Pluggable Systems**. Inspired by smart contract deployment patterns (like CosmWasm), this framework provides infrastructure for component-based architectures with runtime component management capabilities.

## Recent Major Developments
### 2025-10-17 - Terminology Standardization
- **Terminology Update**: Removed hyperbolic terms (Universal, Hot-Deployable, Zero-downtime)
- **Professional Standards**: Established documentation terminology standards for technical accuracy
- **Tagline Refinement**: "WASM Component Framework for Pluggable Systems" - clear and professional

### 2025-09-30 - Strategic Architecture Completion
- **Vision Refinement**: Evolved from simple WASM runtime to general-purpose component framework
- **Runtime Deployment**: Smart contract-inspired deployment patterns without restart as key feature
- **Architecture Completion**: Complete framework architecture designed and documented
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Full implementation plan saved with comprehensive documentation

### Key Strategic Insights
- **General-Purpose Framework**: Not domain-limited - supports AI, web services, IoT, gaming, etc.
- **Runtime Deployment Model**: Component loading, versioning, rollback inspired by blockchain patterns
- **Infrastructure Platform**: Foundation for component-based architectures
- **Key Differentiator**: WASM + runtime deployment + composition in single framework

## Current Work Items
1. **Documentation Standardization**: Update all docs with professional terminology (in-progress)
2. **Architecture Validation**: Review and refine framework design patterns
3. **Integration Planning**: Detailed AirsSys ecosystem integration strategy
4. **Example Development**: Reference implementations across multiple domains

## Next Steps (When Prerequisites Ready)
1. **Core Runtime Implementation**: Wasmtime integration with Component Model
2. **Runtime Deployment Engine**: Component loading and update system
3. **Capability Security**: Fine-grained permission and access control
4. **Developer SDK**: Rich tooling for component development

## Architectural Decisions Made
- **Framework Approach**: General-purpose component framework vs. domain-specific solution
- **Runtime Deployment**: Smart contract-inspired deployment as core feature
- **Technology Stack**: Wasmtime, Component Model, WIT, WASI Preview 2
- **Project Structure**: Simplified workspace integration (core/, sdk/, runtime/)
- **Security Model**: Capability-based access control with deny-by-default

## Key Technical Aspects
1. **Novel Approach**: Combines WASM + runtime deployment + composition
2. **Deployment Model**: Runtime component management inspired by smart contract systems
3. **Infrastructure Platform**: Foundation for component-based software architectures
4. **Cross-Platform**: Provides isolation primitives across different operating systems

## Dependencies & Timeline
- **airssys-osl Foundation**: Requires mature OS layer for secure system access
- **airssys-rt Foundation**: Requires actor system for component hosting
- **Implementation Start**: 2026 Q1 when dependencies are ready
- **Framework Completion**: 2026 Q3-Q4 with full ecosystem features

## Context for Future Sessions
- Complete architectural framework designed and documented
- Strategic positioning as infrastructure platform established
- Revolutionary vision validated and scoped for maximum impact
- Ready for implementation when foundational dependencies are available
- Documentation expansion needed to communicate strategic vision

## Research Insights
- WebAssembly Component Model provides excellent composition primitives
- Capability-based security aligns well with WASM's sandboxing model
- Integration with actor systems enables powerful component hosting patterns
- WASI provides good system interface foundation but needs AirsSys-specific extensions

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project scope and architecture well-defined
- âœ… Security model research completed
- âœ… Integration strategy with AirsSys components planned
- ðŸ”„ Ready for detailed implementation when foundation components are available
