# airssys-wasm Project Brief

## Project Overview
`airssys-wasm` is a revolutionary **Universal Hot-Deployable WASM Component Framework** that brings smart contract-style hot deployment to general-purpose computing. It's the **"CosmWasm for everything"** - enabling developers to build secure, composable, language-agnostic components that can be deployed, updated, and managed without system downtime.

## Project Vision
This is infrastructure-level innovation that creates a **completely new category** of software architecture. Instead of building another plugin system, we're building the **foundational platform** that others will use to solve their specific problems across any domain.

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Universal Component Framework**: Write once, run anywhere with language-agnostic composition
2. **Hot Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates like smart contracts (no restart required)
3. **Capability-Based Security**: Sandbox isolation by default with fine-grained permissions
4. **Language Agnostic**: Support for any WASM-compatible language (Rust, C++, Go, Python, etc.)
5. **Component Composition**: Chain and orchestrate components seamlessly like "Lego bricks"

## Strategic Positioning
- **"Kubernetes for Components"** - Orchestration and isolation
- **"App Store for Server Components"** - Hot deployment and distribution  
- **"Smart Contract Platform for General Computing"** - Secure, composable execution

## Core Responsibilities

### Universal Component Framework
- Language-agnostic component development with WIT interfaces
- Universal component lifecycle management (init, execute, shutdown)
- Component composition and orchestration engine
- Dependency resolution and graph execution

### Hot Deployment System  
- Smart contract-style deployment without host restart
- Zero-downtime update strategies (Blue-Green, Canary, Rolling)
- Instant rollback capabilities with version management
- Traffic routing and load balancing for deployments

### Security & Isolation
- Capability-based security with deny-by-default policies
- Fine-grained permission system for resource access
- Component sandboxing and memory isolation
- Security audit logging and policy enforcement

### AirsSys Ecosystem Integration
- Deep integration with airssys-osl for secure system access
- Integration with airssys-rt for actor-based component hosting
- Unified logging and configuration management
- Host system interface and capability bridging

## Target Use Cases & Domains

### Primary Examples (Not Limitations)
- **AI Agents**: Secure, composable AI agent systems
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools as WASM components
- **Microservices**: Lightweight, hot-deployable microservices
- **Data Processors**: ETL and data transformation pipelines
- **IoT Controllers**: Edge device controllers and processors
- **Plugin Systems**: Secure plugin architectures for any application

### Framework Applications
- Enterprise software with secure plugin ecosystems
- Edge computing with lightweight, secure functions
- AI/ML infrastructure with composable model pipelines
- Gaming platforms with secure mod systems
- Web platforms with secure extensions

## Technical Requirements

### Core Framework Requirements
- Universal component interface supporting any domain/use case
- Hot deployment engine with zero-downtime updates
- Capability-based security system with fine-grained permissions
- Component composition engine for pipeline orchestration
- Version management with instant rollback capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- Component instantiation < 10ms (fast cold starts)
- Hot deployment < 1 second (zero downtime)
- Memory isolation 100% (no component cross-access)
- Rollback time < 5 seconds (instant recovery)
- Throughput > 10,000 component calls/second

### Developer Experience Requirements
- Rich SDK with derive macros for easy development
- WIT interface system for language-agnostic contracts
- Comprehensive testing framework and utilities
- Visual component composition and pipeline building
- Complete documentation with examples across domains

### Integration Requirements
- Deep airssys-osl integration for secure system access
- airssys-rt integration for actor-based hosting
- WASI Preview 2 support for system interface
- Monitoring and observability built-in
- Configuration management and service discovery
- Efficient resource sharing and reuse

### Compatibility Requirements
- WebAssembly Component Model compatibility
- WASI preview 2 support for system interface
- Multiple WASM language support (Rust, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.)
- Integration with existing WASM toolchains and package managers

## Architecture Constraints
- Follow workspace standards (ยง2.1, ยง3.2, ยง4.3, ยง5.1)
- Rust-based implementation with wasmtime or similar runtime
- Zero unsafe code blocks without security review
- Comprehensive security policy validation and enforcement

## Integration Points
- **airssys-osl**: Secure system access through OS layer abstraction
- **airssys-rt**: Actor-based component hosting and lifecycle management
- **Component Ecosystem**: Integration with WASM component registries and tooling

## Success Criteria
- Pass comprehensive security audit for component isolation
- Achieve target performance metrics for component execution
- Successful demonstration of polyglot component composition
- Seamless integration with airssys-osl and airssys-rt components
