# airssys-wasm Project Brief

## Project Overview
`airssys-wasm` is a **WASM Component Framework for Pluggable Systems** that enables runtime component deployment for general-purpose computing. Inspired by smart contract deployment patterns (like CosmWasm), it enables developers to build secure, composable, language-agnostic components that can be loaded and updated during runtime.

## Project Vision
This framework provides infrastructure for building pluggable systems with WebAssembly components, enabling secure isolation and runtime component management. Rather than building application-specific plugin systems, airssys-wasm provides a foundational platform for component-based architectures across multiple domains.

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Cross-Platform Component Framework**: Language-agnostic component development with standard WIT interfaces
2. **Runtime Deployment**: Components can be loaded and updated during runtime without system restart
3. **Capability-Based Security**: Sandbox isolation by default with fine-grained permissions
4. **Language-Agnostic Development**: Support for any WASM-compatible language (Rust, C++, Go, Python, etc.)
5. **Component Composition**: Chain and orchestrate components for complex processing pipelines

## Key Capabilities
- Component orchestration and isolation
- Runtime component deployment and management
- Secure, composable component execution with capability-based security

## Core Responsibilities

### Component Framework
- Language-agnostic component development with WIT interfaces
- Component lifecycle management (init, execute, shutdown)
- Component composition and orchestration engine
- Dependency resolution and graph execution

### Runtime Deployment System  
- Components can be loaded and updated during runtime
- Multiple deployment strategies (Blue-Green, Canary, Rolling)
- Version management with rollback capabilities
- Traffic routing and load balancing for component deployment

### Security & Isolation
- Capability-based security with deny-by-default policies
- Fine-grained permission system for resource access
- Component sandboxing and memory isolation
- Security audit logging and policy enforcement

### AirsSys Ecosystem Integration
- Deep integration with airssys-osl for secure system access
- Integration with airssys-rt for actor-based component hosting
- Unified logging and configuration management
- Host system interface and capability bridging

## Target Use Cases & Domains

### Target Use Cases (Examples)
