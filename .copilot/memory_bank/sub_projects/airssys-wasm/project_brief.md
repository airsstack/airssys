# airssys-wasm Project Brief

## Project Overview
`airssys-wasm` (WASM Pluggable System) provides a secure WebAssembly runtime environment for executing pluggable components within the AirsSys ecosystem. It enables polyglot, composable, and secure applications with deny-by-default security policies.

## Project Goals
1. **Secure Component Execution**: Sandboxed WASM component execution with comprehensive security
2. **Polyglot Composition**: Support for components written in any WASM-compatible language
3. **AirsSys Integration**: Seamless integration with airssys-osl and airssys-rt
4. **Performance Excellence**: High-performance WASM execution with minimal overhead
5. **Component Model Support**: WebAssembly Component Model for composable applications

## Core Responsibilities

### WASM Runtime
- Lightweight WASM VM for executing WASM binaries
- Component Model implementation for composable components
- Efficient module loading and instantiation
- Resource management and isolation per component

### Security Sandbox
- Deny-by-default security policy enforcement
- Fine-grained capability-based access control
- Resource limits and monitoring per component
- Secure host-guest communication channels

### Component System
- Component lifecycle management
- Inter-component communication and composition
- Component registry and discovery
- Hot-reloading and dynamic component updates

### Host Integration
- Integration with airssys-osl for secure system access
- Integration with airssys-rt for actor-based component hosting
- WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) implementation
- Custom host functions for AirsSys ecosystem integration

## Technical Requirements

### Security Requirements
- Complete isolation between components and host system
- Capability-based security with minimal privilege principle
- Comprehensive audit logging of all component operations
- Secure communication channels between components and host

### Performance Requirements
- Fast component instantiation (<10ms for typical components)
- Low memory overhead per component (<512KB baseline)
- High-throughput inter-component communication
- Efficient resource sharing and reuse

### Compatibility Requirements
- WebAssembly Component Model compatibility
- WASI preview 2 support for system interface
- Multiple WASM language support (Rust, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.)
- Integration with existing WASM toolchains and package managers

## Architecture Constraints
- Follow workspace standards (ยง2.1, ยง3.2, ยง4.3, ยง5.1)
- Rust-based implementation with wasmtime or similar runtime
- Zero unsafe code blocks without security review
- Comprehensive security policy validation and enforcement

## Integration Points
- **airssys-osl**: Secure system access through OS layer abstraction
- **airssys-rt**: Actor-based component hosting and lifecycle management
- **Component Ecosystem**: Integration with WASM component registries and tooling

## Success Criteria
- Pass comprehensive security audit for component isolation
- Achieve target performance metrics for component execution
- Successful demonstration of polyglot component composition
- Seamless integration with airssys-osl and airssys-rt components
