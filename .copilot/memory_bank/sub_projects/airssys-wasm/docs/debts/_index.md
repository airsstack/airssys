## Active Debt Items

### DEBT-WASM-001: Deferred WIT Interface Abstractions
- **File:** `debt_wasm_001_deferred_wit_interface_abstractions.md`
- **Status:** Active
- **Category:** DEBT-ARCH
- **Priority:** Low (Technical), Low (Business)
- **Created:** 2025-10-21
- **Summary:** Deferred runtime type abstractions (TypeDescriptor, InterfaceKind, BindingMetadata) following YAGNI analysis
- **Impact:** Positive maintainability (60% less code), zero functional impact
- **Re-evaluation:** Block 10 Phase 2+ (Q2 2026+) for multi-language support

### DEBT-WASM-002: Epoch-Based Preemption Future Enhancement
- **File:** `debt_wasm_002_epoch_preemption_future_enhancement.md`
- **Status:** Active
- **Category:** DEBT-PERF
- **Priority:** Low (Business), Medium (Technical)
- **Created:** 2025-10-24
- **Summary:** Wasmtime epoch-based preemption not implemented; using tokio timeout wrapper instead for simplicity
- **Impact:** Cannot interrupt running WASM code mid-execution; acceptable for trusted components
- **Implementation:** Future enhancement when malicious component handling becomes critical

## Anticipated Debt Categories (Future)

### Expected DEBT-ARCH
- Component Model implementation simplifications for initial release
- Security model compromises during development
- Integration complexity reductions with AirsSys components
- Performance optimization deferrals for component execution

### Expected DEBT-SECURITY
- Capability enforcement simplifications during prototype phase
- Security policy validation reductions for development speed
- Audit logging gaps during initial implementation
- Sandbox escape prevention measures deferred

### Expected DEBT-PERF
- Component instantiation optimizations postponed
- Memory management optimizations deferred
- Communication overhead optimizations delayed
- Resource pooling implementations simplified

### Debt Prevention Strategy (Future)
- Security-first development with comprehensive review process
- Performance benchmarking integrated into development workflow
- Regular architectural review for integration complexity
- Comprehensive testing including security and performance testing

### High-Risk Debt Areas (Future)
- **Security**: Any security shortcuts could compromise entire system
- **Performance**: WASM execution performance critical for adoption
- **Integration**: Poor integration could fragment AirsSys ecosystem
- **Component Model**: Incomplete implementation could limit functionality
