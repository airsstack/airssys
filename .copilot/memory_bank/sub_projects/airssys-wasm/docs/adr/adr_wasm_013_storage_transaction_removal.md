# ADR-WASM-013: Storage Transaction Removal

**ADR ID:** ADR-WASM-013  
**Created:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** AirsSys Architecture Team  

## Title
Remove StorageTransaction Trait - Align Implementation with Actor Model Sequential Processing

## Context

### Problem Statement

During Phase 8 implementation (Storage Backend Abstraction), a `StorageTransaction` trait was implemented in `airssys-wasm/src/core/storage.rs` (lines 430-549). However, **ADR-WASM-007 Decision 5 explicitly rejected transaction support**, stating that transactions are NOT required due to the actor model's sequential message processing guarantees.

This created three critical issues:

1. **Documentation Conflict**: KNOWLEDGE-WASM-007 §6 documented transaction support, conflicting with ADR-WASM-007
2. **Implementation Divergence**: Code implemented a feature explicitly rejected by architectural decision
3. **YAGNI Violation**: ~120 lines of unused code with zero production implementations (only test mocks)

### Business Context

**Consistency Guarantees Required:**
- Components need reliable state consistency
- Multi-key updates must be atomic (e.g., balance transfers)
- Read-modify-write operations must be safe from race conditions

**Actor Model Provides:**
- Sequential message processing per actor
- No concurrent access to component storage within single instance
- Consistency guaranteed by execution model (like EVM, Solana, NEAR)

### Technical Context

**Current Implementation:**
- `StorageTransaction` trait with `add_operation()`, `commit()`, `rollback()` methods
- `StorageBackend::begin_transaction()` method returning `Box<dyn StorageTransaction>`
- Public API export in `core/mod.rs`
- Zero production implementations (only `MockTransaction` for tests)

**ADR-WASM-007 Decision 5 Rationale:**
- Actor model processes messages sequentially (one at a time)
- Component mailbox acts as message queue (like blockchain mempool)
- No concurrent access to component storage within single component instance
- Blockchain precedent: EVM, Solana, NEAR all use sequential execution without storage transactions

**Workspace Standards Alignment:**
- **§6.1 YAGNI Principles**: "Build only what's needed", "Avoid speculative generalization"
- **Microsoft Rust Guidelines M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS**: Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers

### Stakeholders

- **Component Developers**: Rely on storage consistency guarantees
- **Backend Implementers**: Must implement `StorageBackend` trait
- **Runtime Engineers**: Maintain storage abstraction layer
- **Security Team**: Audit storage operations and consistency

## Decision

### Summary

**Remove `StorageTransaction` trait and all related code** from airssys-wasm storage abstraction. Rely exclusively on actor model sequential message processing for storage consistency guarantees.

**Rationale:**

1. **ADR-WASM-007 Already Decided**: Decision 5 explicitly rejected transactions based on actor model analysis
2. **YAGNI Compliance**: Zero production implementations, only test mocks exist
3. **Actor Model Sufficiency**: Sequential processing provides same consistency guarantees as transactions
4. **Blockchain Precedent**: EVM, Solana, NEAR demonstrate pattern viability at scale
5. **Simplification**: Removes ~165 lines of unused code and API complexity

### Assumptions

1. All component storage operations occur within actor message handlers
2. Actor system guarantees sequential message processing (no concurrent handlers)
3. Component crashes handled by supervisor (message replay for recovery)
4. No cross-component atomic operations needed (handled by message coordination)

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Remove StorageTransaction Trait (SELECTED)

**Description**: Completely remove `StorageTransaction` trait, `begin_transaction()` method, and all related code. Rely on actor model for consistency.

**Pros:**
- Aligns implementation with ADR-WASM-007 architectural decision
- YAGNI compliance (removes unused code)
- Simplifies storage API surface (~165 lines removed)
- Reduces backend implementation burden
- Eliminates documentation contradictions
- Actor model provides equivalent consistency guarantees

**Cons:**
- Cannot batch multiple operations with rollback semantics
- Complex multi-key operations require careful sequencing
- If actor model assumptions violated, consistency at risk
- Re-adding later requires trait reintroduction (non-trivial)

**Implementation Effort:** Low (code removal, documentation updates)  
**Risk Level:** Low (zero current usage, actor model proven)

### Option 2: Keep StorageTransaction Trait

**Description**: Reverse ADR-WASM-007 Decision 5, keep trait, require backend implementations.

**Pros:**
- Explicit rollback semantics available
- Backend-specific transaction optimizations possible
- Familiar pattern for database developers
- Future-proofing for unknown requirements

**Cons:**
- Violates ADR-WASM-007 architectural decision
- YAGNI violation (no current need)
- Adds complexity to all backend implementations
- Contradicts actor model sequential processing benefits
- Maintains documentation conflicts
- No identified use case requiring transactions

**Implementation Effort:** Low (documentation updates only)  
**Risk Level:** Medium (technical debt accumulation)

### Option 3: Make Transactions Optional Feature

**Description**: Guard trait with `#[cfg(feature = "storage-transactions")]`, default disabled.

**Pros:**
- Keeps trait available for advanced use cases
- Default behavior aligns with ADR-WASM-007
- Opt-in path for future needs
- No breaking change for future re-introduction

**Cons:**
- Maintains unused code path (YAGNI violation)
- Feature flag complexity for backends
- Documentation must explain when to enable
- Still requires maintenance of unused code
- Increases cognitive load for backend implementers

**Implementation Effort:** Low-Medium (feature flag setup)  
**Risk Level:** Low (isolated behind flag)

## Implementation

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Code Removal (Immediate)**
1. Remove `StorageTransaction` trait (storage.rs:430-549, ~120 lines)
2. Remove `begin_transaction()` from `StorageBackend` trait (~25 lines with docs)
3. Remove `StorageTransaction` from `core/mod.rs` public exports (1 line)
4. Remove `MockTransaction` test implementation (~15 lines)
5. Update `StorageBackend` trait rustdoc to remove transaction examples (~10 lines)

**Phase 2: Documentation Sync (Immediate)**
1. Update KNOWLEDGE-WASM-007: Remove §6 transaction support OR mark as rejected
2. Update ADR-WASM-007: Add confirmation note that implementation followed Decision 5
3. Create ADR-WASM-013: Document removal decision and reasoning (this document)

**Phase 3: Validation (Immediate)**
1. Run `cargo test --workspace` - expect zero failures (no usage exists)
2. Run `cargo clippy --workspace` - expect zero warnings
3. Verify no external references to `StorageTransaction`
4. Update memory bank progress tracking

### Timeline

- Eliminated documentation contradictions

## Compliance

### Workspace Standards

**§6.1 YAGNI Principles:**
- ✅ "Build only what's needed" - Transactions not needed (actor model suffices)
- ✅ "Avoid speculative generalization" - Trait was speculative future-proofing
- ✅ "Remove unused complexity" - Zero production implementations

**§6.2 Avoid dyn Patterns:**
- ✅ Removes `Box<dyn StorageTransaction>` return type
- ✅ Simplifies storage API to direct method calls only

**§4.3 Module Architecture:**
- ✅ Cleaner trait boundaries
- ✅ Reduced API surface in `core/storage.rs`

**Microsoft Rust Guidelines:**

- ✅ **M-YAGNI**: Eliminates speculative capability

### Technical Debt

**Debt Resolved:**
- **DEBT-001**: Documentation conflict between ADR-WASM-007 and KNOWLEDGE-WASM-007 §6
- **DEBT-002**: Implementation divergence from architectural decision
- **DEBT-003**: YAGNI violation with unused trait implementation

**Debt Created:**
- None (removal aligns with architecture, no compromises made)

## Monitoring and Validation

### Success Criteria

1. ✅ All code removed successfully (zero compilation errors)
2. ✅ All tests pass (cargo test --workspace)
3. ✅ Zero warnings (cargo clippy --workspace)
4. ✅ Documentation synchronized (ADR-WASM-007 ↔ KNOWLEDGE-WASM-007)
5. ✅ No external references to `StorageTransaction` remain

### Key Metrics

- **Code Reduction**: ~165 lines removed
- **API Surface**: StorageBackend trait methods reduced by 1
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained at >90% (transaction tests removed, not needed)
- **Build Time**: Marginal improvement (less code to compile)

### Review Schedule

- **Immediate**: Validate removal during implementation
- **Phase 9 Start**: Confirm storage API ergonomics for lifecycle management
- **6 months**: Review if any use cases emerged requiring transactions

## Risks and Mitigations

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Complex Multi-Key Operations Difficult Without Transactions**
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (development friction)
- **Mitigation**: Actor model sequential processing provides same atomicity guarantees. Multi-key operations in single message handler are atomic.
- **Evidence**: EVM, Solana, NEAR all handle complex operations without storage transactions

**Risk 2: Future Use Case Requires Transactions**
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (trait re-introduction needed)
- **Mitigation**: Can re-add trait if proven necessary. Actor model architecture doesn't preclude transactions. Current architecture supports adding back without breaking changes (backend trait extension).
- **Decision Rule**: Only re-add if concrete use case demonstrates actor model insufficient

**Risk 3: Backend-Specific Optimizations Lost**
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Low (marginal performance)
- **Mitigation**: Backends can batch operations internally if beneficial. Actor model message boundaries provide natural batching points.

### Contingency Plans

**If Transaction Support Needed Later:**
1. Assess specific use case and requirements
2. Validate actor model cannot provide equivalent guarantees
3. Design transaction trait based on actual requirements (not speculation)
4. Extend `StorageBackend` trait (non-breaking if done carefully)
5. Update ADR-WASM-013 status to "Superseded"
6. Create new ADR documenting transaction re-introduction rationale

**If Actor Model Assumptions Violated:**
1. Review actor system implementation for sequential processing guarantee
2. Add explicit enforcement/validation if needed
3. Consider transactions only if actor model fix impractical
