# [WASM-TASK-002] - Block 1: WASM Runtime Layer

**Status:** âœ… complete (All 6 phases complete - 100%)  
**Added:** 2025-10-20  
**Completed:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Priority:** Critical Path - Foundation Layer  
**Layer:** 1 - Foundation  
**Block:** 1 of 11  
**Actual Effort:** 4 days (Oct 20-24, 2025)  

## Overview

Implement the foundational WASM runtime layer that executes WebAssembly Component Model modules with security and resource control. This block provides the core execution engine for all WASM components, including memory sandboxing, CPU limiting, async execution, and crash isolation.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Architecture complete: ADR-WASM-002 (WASM Runtime Engine Selection)
- Technology selected: Wasmtime with Component Model support
- Integration requirements: Tokio async runtime for airssys-rt compatibility
- Resource limiting strategy: Hybrid fuel metering + wall-clock timeout

**Problem Statement:**
The framework needs a robust WASM execution engine that:
1. Executes Component Model WASM modules (not core WASM)
2. Enforces strict memory limits (512KB-4MB configurable)
3. Prevents CPU abuse with dual-layer protection
4. Integrates seamlessly with Tokio async ecosystem
5. Isolates component crashes from host runtime
6. Provides fast instantiation (<10ms cold start target)

**Why This Block Matters:**
The WASM runtime layer is the absolute foundation of the framework. Without this:
- No WASM code can execute
- Security boundaries cannot be enforced
- Resource limiting is impossible
- Integration with airssys-rt fails

This block must complete before ANY other components can be implemented.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Build a production-ready WASM runtime engine using Wasmtime that executes Component Model modules with enforced memory/CPU limits, async support, and isolated crash handling.

### Secondary Objectives
- Achieve <10ms cold start instantiation time

## Notes

**Critical Foundation:**
This block is the absolute foundation. Nothing else can proceed until WASM code can execute safely.

**Module Structure:**
Following KNOWLEDGE-WASM-012 (Module Structure Architecture), runtime code lives in `src/runtime/`:
- `runtime/engine.rs` - Wasmtime engine wrapper
- `runtime/instance.rs` - Component instance management
- `runtime/limits.rs` - Resource limits (memory, CPU)
- `runtime/loader.rs` - Component loading
- `runtime/executor.rs` - Component execution

**Security First:**
Memory and CPU limits are REQUIRED, not optional. Components MUST declare limits in Component.toml.

**Performance Baseline First:**
Phase 6 focuses on **measurement**, not optimization. We establish baseline performance characteristics before attempting optimization. "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - we're at phase 1.

**Async Complexity:**
Wasmtime async support is mature but complex. Follow examples closely and test extensively.

**Crash Isolation:**
Production systems will have buggy components. Crash isolation is not optional.

**Testing Strategy:**
Include adversarial testing (infinite loops, OOM attempts, malformed components).

**Phase 1 Simplicity:**
This is Phase 1 - focus on correct, safe implementation. Optimizations can come in Phase 2 based on measured performance data.
