**Actions:**
```bash
# Create test crate directory
mkdir -p tests/build_system/test-crate

# Initialize test crate
cd tests/build_system/test-crate
cargo init --lib

# Create WIT directory structure
mkdir -p wit/test-types
mkdir -p wit/test-component
```

**Test Crate Structure:**
```
tests/build_system/test-crate/
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
├── wit/
│   ├── test-types/
│   │   ├── types.wit           # Minimal types package
│   │   └── deps.toml           # No dependencies
│   └── test-component/
│       ├── component.wit       # Component using types
│       └── deps.toml           # Depends on test-types
└── src/
    └── lib.rs
```

**Create Minimal WIT Files:**

**`wit/test-types/types.wit`:**
```wit
package test:types@1.0.0;

interface types {
    record test-result {
        success: bool,
        message: string,
    }
}
```

**`wit/test-component/component.wit`:**
```wit
package test:component@1.0.0;

use test:types@1.0.0.{test-result};

interface component {
    execute: func() -> test-result;
}
```

**`wit/test-component/deps.toml`:**
```toml
[dependencies]
"test:types" = { path = "../test-types" }
```

**Activity 3.2 (20 min): Configure wit-bindgen in build.rs**

**Research Task:**
- Study wit-bindgen Rust API for build.rs
- Document correct API usage
- Test minimal configuration

**Example build.rs (To Research and Implement):**
```rust
// build.rs
fn main() {
    // Research: How to configure wit-bindgen?
    // What crate provides the API?
    // wit_bindgen_rust_macro? wit_bindgen_core?
    
    // Goal: Generate bindings for wit/test-component/
    // Must resolve dependency on wit/test-types/
    
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=wit/");
}
```

**Research Questions:**
- [ ] What crate provides build.rs API?
- [ ] How to specify WIT input path?
- [ ] How to specify output path?
- [ ] How to configure dependency resolution?

**Activity 3.3 (20 min): Configure Cargo.toml**

**Cargo.toml Configuration:**
```toml
[package]
name = "test-crate"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Research: What runtime dependencies are needed?
# wit-bindgen-rt?
# wasmtime? (if generating host bindings)

[build-dependencies]
# Research: What build dependencies are needed?
# wit-bindgen?
# wit-bindgen-core?
```

**Research Task:**
- Identify correct wit-bindgen crates
- Document version requirements
- Test minimal configuration

**Deliverable:** Partially complete test crate structure ready for binding generation

---

#### Hour 4 (60 min): Binding Generation Validation

**Activity 4.1 (30 min): Generate bindings for test package**

**Actions:**
```bash
cd tests/build_system/test-crate

# Attempt to build (triggers build.rs)
cargo build

# Expected outcomes:
# 1. build.rs runs wit-bindgen
# 2. Rust code generated in target/
# 3. Generated code compiles
# 4. Test crate builds successfully
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check build succeeds:** `cargo build` exits with 0
2. **Inspect generated code:** Find and examine generated Rust files
3. **Verify types:** Check test-result type is accessible
4. **Verify traits:** Check component interface becomes Rust trait
5. **Document structure:** Record generated code organization

**If Build Fails:**
- Document exact error messages
- Research error causes
- Adjust configuration
- Iterate until successful

**Activity 4.2 (30 min): Test multi-package binding generation**

**Validation Goal:**
Confirm that:
1. wit-bindgen reads deps.toml
2. Cross-package type imports resolve
3. test-component can use types from test-types
4. Generated code maintains type safety

**Test Approach:**
```rust
// In src/lib.rs, test using generated bindings
// Example (pseudocode):
use generated::types::TestResult;
use generated::component::Component;

// Can we instantiate types?
// Can we implement component trait?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ cargo build succeeds with no errors
- ✅ Generated code is accessible from src/lib.rs
- ✅ Cross-package types resolve correctly
- ✅ Type safety maintained (no any/dynamic types)

**Deliverable:** `tests/build_system/test-crate/` - Working test crate with bindings

**Deliverable:** `docs/research/binding_generation_validation.md`

**Content:**
- Build process documentation
- Generated code structure analysis
- Validation test results
- Error messages encountered and solutions
- Multi-package binding confirmation
- Success criteria verification

### Hour 5: Build System Integration Strategy (1 hour)

#### Activity 5.1 (30 min): airssys-wasm Build Integration Design

**Design Goals:**
- Generate bindings for all 7 WIT packages
- Integrate with airssys-wasm Cargo workspace
- Support incremental builds (only rebuild when WIT changes)
- Organize generated code cleanly

**build.rs Design for airssys-wasm:**

**Structure:**
```rust
// airssys-wasm/build.rs (DESIGN)

fn main() {
    // Step 1: Generate bindings for core packages
    generate_bindings("wit/core/types");
    generate_bindings("wit/core/component");
    generate_bindings("wit/core/capabilities");
    generate_bindings("wit/core/host");
    
    // Step 2: Generate bindings for extension packages
    generate_bindings("wit/ext/filesystem");
    generate_bindings("wit/ext/network");
    generate_bindings("wit/ext/process");
    
    // Step 3: Configure rebuild triggers
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=wit/");
}

fn generate_bindings(wit_path: &str) {
    // Research-based implementation
    // Use API discovered in Hour 3-4
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Generate all packages in single build.rs
- OR separate build.rs per package?
- Where to place generated code?
- How to expose generated code to airssys-wasm crate?

**Activity 5.2 (30 min): Cargo.toml Configuration Strategy**

**airssys-wasm Cargo.toml Design:**

**Dependencies to Research:**
```toml
[dependencies]
# Runtime dependencies for generated code
wit-bindgen-rt = "?" # Research version
wasmtime = { version = "25.0.0", features = ["component-model"] }

# Other dependencies from existing implementation
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
# ... existing deps

[build-dependencies]
# Build-time dependencies for binding generation
wit-bindgen = "?" # Research correct crate and version
```

**Feature Flags Strategy:**
- Optional extension packages?
- Development-only features?
- Binding generation features?

**Workspace Integration:**
- How does airssys-wasm fit in workspace?
- Dependencies on other workspace crates?
- Generated code visibility?

**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** High (would require manual bindings)  
**Mitigation:**
- Test early with proof-of-concept crate
- Research WASI multi-package patterns (proven working)
- Have fallback: generate bindings per package separately
- Document workarounds if limitations found

### Risk 2: Generated code doesn't compile

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (would need configuration adjustments)  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with minimal test package
- Iterate to complexity gradually
- Document all compilation errors
- Research error solutions thoroughly
- Test with simple types before complex ones

### Risk 3: Build system complexity too high

**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** Low (can simplify if needed)  
**Mitigation:**
- Keep build.rs simple and well-documented
- Document all configuration clearly
- Test on clean builds
- Provide troubleshooting guide
- Have fallback: manual binding generation

### Risk 4: deps.toml integration issues

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (cross-package types wouldn't resolve)  
**Mitigation:**
- Test deps.toml integration in proof-of-concept
- Research WASI patterns (proven working)
- Document exact configuration requirements
- Validate with multi-package test
- Have fallback: inline types if needed
