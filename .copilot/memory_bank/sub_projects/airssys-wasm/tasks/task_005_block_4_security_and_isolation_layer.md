# [WASM-TASK-005] - Block 4: Security & Isolation Layer

**Status:** not-started  
**Added:** 2025-10-20  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Priority:** Critical Path - Core Services Layer  
**Layer:** 2 - Core Services  
**Block:** 4 of 11  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-6 weeks  

## Overview

Implement the multi-layered security and isolation system that protects the host from malicious or buggy components through fine-grained capability-based permissions, pattern matching for resources, trust-level workflows, actor isolation, and supervision trees. This block establishes the security foundation that all host function access depends upon.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Architecture complete: ADR-WASM-005 (Capability-Based Security Model)
- Foundation ready: Block 3 (Actor System Integration) provides ComponentActor isolation
- Block 1 provides: WASM memory sandboxing (512KB-4MB isolated linear memory)
- Security model: Deny-by-default, least privilege, explicit declaration

**Problem Statement:**
Components require access to host resources (filesystem, network, storage) but:
1. **Threat: Resource Abuse** - Component declares "read config.toml" but reads /etc/passwd
2. **Threat: Network Abuse** - Component declares "call api.example.com" but exfiltrates data
3. **Threat: Resource Exhaustion** - Component declares "100MB storage" but writes 10GB
4. **Challenge: Developer Experience** - Security shouldn't block legitimate development

The framework needs multi-layered defense:
- **Layer 1**: Capability-based security (permission checks at host functions)
- **Layer 2**: WASM linear memory sandbox (bounds checking)
- **Layer 3**: Actor isolation (private mailbox, message passing only)
- **Layer 4**: Supervision trees (automatic restart, health monitoring)

**Why This Block Matters:**
Without this security layer:
- Components could access unauthorized files/network/storage
- No defense against malicious third-party components
- Host system vulnerable to compromise
- No production-ready trust model

This block enables safe execution of untrusted third-party components.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Implement fine-grained capability-based security with pattern matching (filesystem globs, network domains, storage namespaces), trust-level workflows (trusted instant install, unknown review), and integration with actor isolation and supervision to create defense-in-depth protection.

### Secondary Objectives
- Achieve <1-5μs capability check overhead (0.1% of typical operation)
- Implement trust-level system for developer-friendly workflows
- Integrate with airssys-osl RBAC/ACL for layered security
- Create comprehensive security audit logging
- Establish dev mode for rapid iteration with warnings

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- ✅ WASM-TASK-002: WASM Runtime Layer (Block 1) - **REQUIRED** for memory sandbox
- ✅ WASM-TASK-004: Actor System Integration (Block 3) - **REQUIRED** for ComponentActor isolation
- ✅ ADR-WASM-005: Capability-Based Security Model - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ ADR-WASM-006: Component Isolation and Sandboxing - **COMPLETE**

### Downstream Dependencies (Blocks This Task)
- WASM-TASK-006: Inter-Component Communication (Block 5) - needs message security
- WASM-TASK-007: Persistent Storage (Block 6) - needs storage capability enforcement
- WASM-TASK-008: Component Lifecycle (Block 7) - needs trust-level workflows
- WASM-TASK-009: AirsSys-OSL Bridge (Block 8) - needs capability checks for host functions

### External Dependencies
- airssys-osl RBAC/ACL system (external, currently 85% complete)
- glob pattern matching library (consider using `globset` crate)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Pattern Matching Performance
**Impact:** High - Slow checks could bottleneck all operations  
**Probability:** Medium - Pattern matching can be expensive  
**Mitigation:**
- Use compiled glob patterns (one-time compilation cost)
- Cache capability check results where possible
- Benchmark extensively and optimize hot paths
- Target <5μs includes pattern compilation

### Risk 2: Bypass Vulnerabilities
**Impact:** Critical - Security bypass defeats entire system  
**Probability:** Medium - Complex systems have edge cases  
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive security testing with bypass attempts
- Code review by security experts
- Penetration testing with malicious components
- Bug bounty program consideration for Phase 2

### Risk 3: Developer Experience Friction
**Impact:** High - Poor UX could hinder adoption  
**Probability:** Medium - Security often conflicts with ease of use  
**Mitigation:**
- Trust-level system enables instant install for trusted sources
- DevMode for rapid development iteration
- Clear error messages for capability denials
- Comprehensive documentation with examples

### Risk 4: airssys-osl Integration Complexity
**Impact:** Medium - Integration issues could delay Block 8  
**Probability:** Low - airssys-osl has stable RBAC/ACL API  
**Mitigation:**
- Design capability layer to be independent
- Abstract airssys-osl integration behind trait
- Test capability layer without airssys-osl first
- Clear integration interface contract

### Risk 5: Quota System Overhead
**Impact:** Medium - Quota tracking could impact performance  
**Probability:** Low - Simple counters are fast  
**Mitigation:**
- Use atomic counters for lock-free updates
- Batch quota checks where possible
- Optimize quota storage (in-memory with periodic persistence)
- Benchmark quota overhead separately

## Notes

**Multi-Layer Defense:**
This block implements Layer 1 (Capabilities) of the 4-layer security model:
- Layer 1: Capability-based security (this block)
- Layer 2: WASM linear memory sandbox (Block 1)
- Layer 3: Actor isolation (Block 3)
- Layer 4: Supervision trees (Block 3)

**Performance Critical:**
Capability checks are in the hot path of EVERY host function call. <5μs overhead is non-negotiable.

**Trust-Level is Key to UX:**
Without trust levels, every component would require manual approval. Trust system enables:
- Internal components: instant install
- Known publishers: instant install
- Unknown sources: review required
- Development: rapid iteration

**Pattern Matching Security:**
Glob patterns are powerful but must be implemented correctly:
- `**` must not escape filesystem boundaries
- Symlink handling must be secure
- Path canonicalization required

**Deny-by-Default:**
Components start with ZERO permissions. All capabilities must be explicitly declared and granted.

**Developer Documentation Critical:**
Security is only effective if developers understand it. Comprehensive examples and troubleshooting essential.

**Audit Logging Non-Optional:**
All capability checks (granted AND denied) must be logged for security analysis.

**Integration with Block 3:**
This block heavily depends on ComponentActor isolation from Block 3. Actor boundaries are security boundaries.

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Custom capability types (domain-specific permissions)
- Advanced quota systems (network bandwidth, CPU time)
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with external security services
