# airssys-wasm Task Files - Implementation Guide

This directory contains 12 detailed task specifications for implementing the airssys-wasm Component Framework.

## Task Overview

### Layer 1: Foundation (Blocks 1-3) - CRITICAL PATH

- **[WASM-TASK-004]** Block 3: Actor System Integration ⭐ CRITICAL (4-5 weeks) ✅ CREATED

### Layer 2: Core Services (Blocks 4-7)
- **[WASM-TASK-005]** Block 4: Security & Isolation Layer (5-6 weeks) - TO CREATE
- **[WASM-TASK-006]** Block 5: Inter-Component Communication (5-6 weeks) - TO CREATE
- **[WASM-TASK-007]** Block 6: Persistent Storage System (4-5 weeks) - TO CREATE
- **[WASM-TASK-008]** Block 7: Component Lifecycle System (6-7 weeks) - TO CREATE

### Layer 3: Integration & Operations (Blocks 8-9)
- **[WASM-TASK-009]** Block 8: AirsSys-OSL Bridge (5-6 weeks) - TO CREATE
- **[WASM-TASK-010]** Block 9: Monitoring & Observability (4-5 weeks) - TO CREATE

### Layer 4: Developer Experience (Blocks 10-11)

- **[WASM-TASK-012]** Block 11: CLI Tool (4-5 weeks) - TO CREATE

## Task File Format

Each task file follows this structure:
1. Header (status, dates, priority, layer, block, effort)
2. Overview (single paragraph)
3. Context (current state, problem statement, why it matters)
4. Objectives (primary and secondary)
5. Scope (in scope, out of scope)
6. Implementation Plan (6 phases with detailed subtasks)
7. Success Criteria (definition of done checklist)
8. Dependencies (upstream, downstream, external)
9. Risks and Mitigations (5 major risks with impact/probability/mitigation)
10. Progress Tracking (phase breakdown, subtasks table)
11. Progress Log
12. Related Documentation (ADRs, knowledge docs, external references)
13. Notes (critical insights and reminders)

## Naming Convention

Task files follow the pattern:
```
task_NNN_block_N_descriptive_name.md
```

Examples:
- `task_002_block_1_wasm_runtime_layer.md`
- `task_003_block_2_wit_interface_system.md`
- `task_004_block_3_actor_system_integration.md`

## Implementation Sequence

**CRITICAL: Follow this exact sequence:**

1. **Layer 1 MUST complete first** (Blocks 1-3)
   - Block 3 (Actor System Integration) is especially critical
   - Layer 1 Gate validation required before Layer 2

2. **Layer 2 builds on Layer 1** (Blocks 4-7)
   - All blocks depend on Block 3 (MessageBroker, SupervisorNode, ComponentActor)
   - Layer 2 Gate validation required before Layer 3

3. **Layer 3 integrates systems** (Blocks 8-9)
   - Requires mature Layer 2 components
   - Layer 3 Gate validation required before Layer 4

4. **Layer 4 enhances developer experience** (Blocks 10-11)
   - Can begin with mocked backends
   - Full functionality requires all previous layers

## Status Tracking

Track task status in `_index.md` with these states:
- `not-started`: Task defined but work has not begun
- `in-progress`: Active development in progress
- `blocked`: Waiting on dependencies or external factors
- `review`: Implementation complete, awaiting review
- `completed`: Task finished and validated

## Next Steps

1. Create remaining task files (WASM-TASK-005 through WASM-TASK-012)
2. Update `_index.md` with complete task catalog
3. Begin implementation with Layer 1 (Blocks 1-3)
4. Validate Layer 1 Gate before proceeding to Layer 2
