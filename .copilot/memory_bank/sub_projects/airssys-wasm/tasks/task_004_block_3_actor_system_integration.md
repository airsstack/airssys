# [WASM-TASK-004] - Block 3: Actor System Integration ⭐ FOUNDATIONAL

**Status:** not-started  
**Added:** 2025-10-20  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Priority:** CRITICAL PATH - Foundation Layer  
**Layer:** 1 - Foundation  
**Block:** 3 of 11  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 weeks  

## Overview

**⭐ CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL BLOCK**

Integrate WASM component execution with the airssys-rt actor system, establishing the core architectural pattern of "actor-hosted WASM components from the start". This block implements ComponentActor (Actor + Child dual trait), integrates ActorSystem spawning, SupervisorNode supervision, and MessageBroker routing to create the fundamental isolation and communication infrastructure that ALL subsequent blocks depend on.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Architecture complete: ADR-WASM-006 (Component Isolation and Sandboxing - Actor-based approach)
- Actor system ready: airssys-rt foundation phase complete (100% COMPLETE)
- Performance proven: ~625ns actor spawn, ~211ns MessageBroker routing, 10,000+ concurrent actors
- Integration requirements: ComponentActor, SupervisorNode, MessageBroker, ActorSystem::spawn()

**Critical Architectural Correction (ADR-WASM-010):**
Initial planning placed Actor System Integration as Block 9 (integration layer). Architectural review revealed it MUST be Block 3 (foundation layer):

**Why This Is Foundational, Not Integration:**
1. **MessageBroker is Core Infrastructure** - Block 5 (Inter-Component Communication) depends on MessageBroker
2. **ComponentActor Pattern is Fundamental** - All components ARE actors from the start
3. **Supervision is Not Optional** - Block 7 (Component Lifecycle) requires SupervisorNode for health management
4. **Isolation Model Requires Actors** - ADR-WASM-006 explicitly uses Erlang-style lightweight processes

**The Correct Mental Model:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: "WASM components, then integrate actors later"
- ✅ **Right**: "Actor-hosted WASM components from the start"

This is analogous to:
- You can't build async code without Tokio
- You can't build a web server without an HTTP library
- **You can't build airssys-wasm without airssys-rt**

**Problem Statement:**
The framework needs to:
1. Host each WASM component instance within its own ComponentActor
2. Implement Actor trait for message handling and Child trait for WASM lifecycle
3. Integrate ActorSystem::spawn() for all component instantiation (NOT manual tokio::spawn)
4. Connect SupervisorNode for automatic component restart on crashes
5. Route inter-component messages through MessageBroker
6. Achieve target performance: ~2-11ms component spawn (includes WASM loading)

**Why This Block Matters:**
Without this block:
- Inter-component communication (Block 5) cannot be implemented
- Component lifecycle management (Block 7) has no supervision system
- Component isolation (Block 4) has no actor boundaries
- Monitoring (Block 9) has no health status to observe

**This block MUST complete before Layer 2 (Blocks 4-7) can begin.**

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Integrate WASM component execution with airssys-rt actor system by implementing ComponentActor (Actor + Child), ActorSystem spawning, SupervisorNode supervision, and MessageBroker routing to establish the foundational actor-hosted component architecture.

### Secondary Objectives
- Achieve target performance: <5ms average component spawn (including WASM load)
- Implement automatic component restart on crashes via SupervisorNode

4. **SupervisorNode Integration** - Component supervision with automatic restart
5. **MessageBroker Integration** - Pub-sub routing for inter-component messages
6. **Message Handling** - Actor::handle_message() implementation for component messages
7. **Performance Optimization** - Achieve spawn and routing performance targets
8. **Testing Framework** - Actor-based component testing utilities

### Out of Scope
- Capability-based security enforcement (Block 4)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Actor Pattern Complexity
**Impact:** High - Wrong actor design could require major refactoring  
**Probability:** Medium - First time integrating actors with WASM  
**Mitigation:**
- Follow ADR-WASM-006 actor design closely
- Reference airssys-rt patterns and examples
- Early prototyping of ComponentActor
- Code review by airssys-rt experts

### Risk 2: Performance Not Meeting Targets
**Impact:** High - Could make framework unusable at scale  
**Probability:** Medium - Adding WASM overhead to actor spawning  
**Mitigation:**
- Profile spawn path extensively
- Optimize WASM loading (module caching from Block 1)
- Benchmark continuously during development
- airssys-rt proven performance provides baseline

### Risk 3: Supervisor Complexity
**Impact:** Medium - Wrong supervision could cause instability  
**Probability:** Low - airssys-rt SupervisorNode is mature  
**Mitigation:**
- Use SupervisorNode patterns from airssys-rt
- Test restart scenarios extensively
- Implement conservative restart policies initially
- Document supervision behavior clearly

### Risk 4: MessageBroker Routing Issues
**Impact:** High - Broken routing breaks inter-component communication  
**Probability:** Low - MessageBroker proven in airssys-rt  
**Mitigation:**
- Follow MessageBroker usage patterns from airssys-rt
- Test pub-sub scenarios thoroughly
- Validate routing performance early
- airssys-rt provides proven routing (~211ns)

### Risk 5: Integration Timing with Block 1
**Impact:** Medium - Block 1 delays could block this work  
**Probability:** Low - Blocks can overlap partially  
**Mitigation:**
- Stub WASM runtime initially for actor testing
- Parallel development where possible
- Integration testing as Block 1 completes
- Clear interface contract between blocks

## Notes

**⭐ CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL BLOCK:**
This is NOT an "integration layer" block. It's FOUNDATIONAL. All of Layer 2 (Blocks 4-7) depends on this.

**Mental Model Correction:**
- ❌ Wrong: "Build WASM components, then add actors for communication"
- ✅ Right: "Every component IS an actor from the start"

**Analogy:**
- Can't build web app without HTTP library
- Can't build async code without Tokio
- Can't build airssys-wasm without airssys-rt

**Performance Baseline:**
airssys-rt has proven performance:
- Actor spawn: ~625ns
- MessageBroker routing: ~211ns
- 10,000+ concurrent actors

Adding WASM overhead (2-10ms) gives target: <5ms average spawn, <10ms P99.

**Dual Trait Pattern:**
ComponentActor implements BOTH:
- Actor: for message handling (mailbox pattern)
- Child: for WASM lifecycle (supervisor-controlled)

This is NOT optional. It's the core pattern.

**ActorSystem::spawn() Requirement:**
ALL component instantiation MUST use ActorSystem::spawn(), NOT tokio::spawn().
This provides proper actor registration and supervision.

**SupervisorNode Integration:**
SupervisorNode is NOT optional. All components MUST be supervised for production reliability.

**MessageBroker as Communication Backbone:**
Block 5 (Inter-Component Communication) builds on MessageBroker foundation established here.

**Layer 1 Gate:**
This block's completion is the Layer 1 validation gate. Blocks 4-7 CANNOT proceed until this passes.

**Testing Strategy:**
Early prototyping critical. Test actor patterns before full WASM integration. Mock WASM runtime if Block 1 delays.

**Code Review Requirement:**
This block MUST have code review by airssys-rt experts to ensure correct actor usage patterns.
