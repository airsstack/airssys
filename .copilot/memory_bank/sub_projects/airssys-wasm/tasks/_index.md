## Implementation Strategy Reference

**Build Order:** Follow ADR-WASM-010 Implementation Strategy  
**Dependencies:** Each layer completes before next begins  
**Parallelization:** Blocks within same layer can develop in parallel  
**Gates:** Layer validation required before proceeding

**Critical Correction from ADR-WASM-010:**  
Actor System Integration (Block 3) is FOUNDATIONAL (Layer 1), not integration layer.  
Blocks 5, 7, and 9 all depend on Block 3 (MessageBroker, SupervisorNode, ComponentActor).

## External Dependencies

### airssys-rt (CRITICAL - Required for Block 3)
**Status:** Foundation phase complete (Q4 2025)  
**Required APIs:**
- MessageBroker (InMemoryMessageBroker)
- Actor trait and Child trait
- ActorSystem::spawn() and SupervisorNode
- Proven performance: ~625ns spawn, ~211ns routing, 10,000+ concurrent actors

### airssys-osl (Required for Block 8)
**Status:** 85% complete (Q1 2026)  
**Required APIs:**
- Filesystem operations (read/write/stat)
- Process operations (spawn/kill/signal)
- Network operations (TCP/UDP/HTTP)
- RBAC/ACL integration

### Wasmtime (Required for Block 1)
**Status:** Stable (Component Model v24.0+)  
**Required Features:**
- Component Model support
- Async execution
- Fuel metering
- Cranelift JIT compilation

## Task Lifecycle States

- `not-started`: Task defined but work has not begun
- `in-progress`: Active development in progress
- `blocked`: Waiting on dependencies or external factors
- `review`: Implementation complete, awaiting review
- `completed`: Task finished and validated

## Planning Notes

**Current Phase:** Architecture & Planning (ADR-WASM-010 complete)  
**Next Milestone:** WASM-TASK-001 (Define detailed roadmap and phase breakdown)  
**Implementation Start:** Q3 2026 (pending airssys-rt maturity)

**Timeline Estimate:** 11-15 months total implementation  
- Layer 1: 3-4 months (Foundation)
- Layer 2: 4-5 months (Core Services)
- Layer 3: 2-3 months (Integration)
- Layer 4: 2-3 months (Developer Tools)
