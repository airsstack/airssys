# [WASM-TASK-001] - Implementation Roadmap and Phase Planning

**Status:** not-started  
**Added:** 2025-10-20  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Layer:** Planning  

## Overview

This task establishes the detailed implementation roadmap for the airssys-wasm component framework based on ADR-WASM-010 Implementation Strategy and Build Order. It breaks down the 11 major building blocks into concrete implementation phases with specific deliverables, timelines, success criteria, and validation gates.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Architecture complete: 8 ADRs accepted (WASM-001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007, 009, 010)
- Knowledge base: 11 knowledge docs covering all major architectural patterns
- Implementation strategy: ADR-WASM-010 defines 4-layer approach with correct dependency order
- Critical discovery: Actor System Integration is foundational (Block 3), not integration layer

**Problem Statement:**
ADR-WASM-010 provides high-level build order (11 blocks across 4 layers), but lacks:
1. Detailed phase breakdown for each block
2. Specific implementation subtasks and work packages
3. Concrete success criteria and validation gates
4. Resource allocation and parallel work identification
5. Risk mitigation strategies for each phase
6. Integration validation approaches between blocks

**Why This Task Matters:**
Without detailed planning, the team could:
- Miss critical dependencies between subtasks
- Allocate resources inefficiently
- Discover integration issues late
- Struggle with unclear success criteria
- Face timeline slippage due to poor estimation

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Create a comprehensive, actionable implementation roadmap that breaks down ADR-WASM-010's 11 blocks into concrete phases with:
- Detailed subtask definitions
- Clear success criteria
- Validation approaches
- Resource requirements
- Risk mitigation plans

### Secondary Objectives
- Identify parallel work opportunities to reduce critical path
- Define layer gate validation requirements
- Establish performance benchmarking approach
- Create task dependency graph
- Define progress tracking methodology

## Scope

### In Scope
1. **Detailed Phase Breakdown** - Each of 11 blocks broken into phases
2. **Task Definition** - Create WASM-TASK-002 through WASM-TASK-012 specifications
3. **Success Criteria** - Concrete, measurable outcomes for each block
4. **Validation Gates** - Layer gate requirements (4 gates total)
5. **Dependency Mapping** - Visual dependency graph for all tasks
6. **Resource Planning** - Estimated effort and team allocation
7. **Risk Analysis** - Risks and mitigations for each block

### Out of Scope
- Actual implementation work (belongs in WASM-TASK-002+)
- Detailed code design (covered in knowledge docs and ADRs)
- Tool selection beyond what's already decided in ADRs
- Budget and financial planning (project management concern)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Over-specification
**Impact:** Medium - Could waste time on unnecessary detail  
**Probability:** Low - We have clear ADRs and knowledge docs to guide  
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on actionable subtasks, not design details
- Reference ADRs/knowledge docs instead of duplicating content
- Keep task specs concise and implementation-focused

### Risk 2: Underestimating Complexity
**Impact:** High - Could lead to unrealistic timelines  
**Probability:** Medium - Some blocks are novel implementations  
**Mitigation:**
- Add buffer time to estimates (use ranges, not single numbers)
- Include research/spike phases for uncertain areas
- Plan for iteration and adjustment

### Risk 3: Misaligned Priorities
**Impact:** Medium - Could optimize wrong aspects  
**Probability:** Low - ADR-WASM-010 provides clear priorities  
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize critical path items (Foundation layer)
- Clearly mark CRITICAL tasks (Block 3 Actor Integration)
- Reference ADR-WASM-010 priority guidance

### Risk 4: Incomplete Dependency Mapping
**Impact:** High - Could miss critical dependencies  
**Probability:** Medium - Complex inter-block dependencies  
**Mitigation:**
- Review ADR-WASM-010 dependency graph carefully
- Cross-reference with knowledge docs
- Validate dependencies with team review

## Notes

**Critical Insight from ADR-WASM-010:**  
Actor System Integration (Block 3, WASM-TASK-004) is FOUNDATIONAL, not an integration layer component. This MUST be emphasized in task specification. Blocks 5, 7, and 9 all depend on Block 3.

**Mental Model to Reinforce:**  
"Actor-hosted WASM components from the start" (NOT "WASM components, then integrate actors later")

**Task Naming Convention:**  
- Task files: `task_NNN_block_N_descriptive_name.md`
- Task IDs: `[WASM-TASK-NNN]`
- Follows airssys-rt pattern for consistency

**Estimated Total Planning Time:** 5-7 weeks  
**Estimated Total Implementation Time:** 11-15 months (per ADR-WASM-010)
