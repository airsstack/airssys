# [WASM-TASK-001] - Implementation Roadmap and Phase Planning

**Status:** SKIPPED/NOT_NEEDED  
**Added:** 2025-10-20  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Skipped:** 2025-10-22  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Layer:** Planning  
**Rationale:** Phase 12 of WASM-TASK-000 already provides comprehensive block readiness validation, making this planning task redundant  

## Overview

This task establishes the detailed implementation roadmap for the airssys-wasm component framework based on ADR-WASM-010 Implementation Strategy and Build Order. It breaks down the 11 major building blocks into concrete implementation phases with specific deliverables, timelines, success criteria, and validation gates.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Architecture complete: 8 ADRs accepted (WASM-001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007, 009, 010)
- Knowledge base: 11 knowledge docs covering all major architectural patterns
- Implementation strategy: ADR-WASM-010 defines 4-layer approach with correct dependency order
- Critical discovery: Actor System Integration is foundational (Block 3), not integration layer

**Problem Statement:**
ADR-WASM-010 provides high-level build order (11 blocks across 4 layers), but lacks:
1. Detailed phase breakdown for each block
2. Specific implementation subtasks and work packages
3. Concrete success criteria and validation gates
4. Resource allocation and parallel work identification
5. Risk mitigation strategies for each phase
6. Integration validation approaches between blocks

**Why This Task Matters:**
Without detailed planning, the team could:
- Miss critical dependencies between subtasks
- Allocate resources inefficiently
- Discover integration issues late
- Struggle with unclear success criteria
- Face timeline slippage due to poor estimation

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Create a comprehensive, actionable implementation roadmap that breaks down ADR-WASM-010's 11 blocks into concrete phases with:
- Detailed subtask definitions
- Clear success criteria
- Validation approaches
- Resource requirements
- Risk mitigation plans

### Secondary Objectives
- Identify parallel work opportunities to reduce critical path
- Define layer gate validation requirements
- Establish performance benchmarking approach
- Create task dependency graph
- Define progress tracking methodology

## Scope

### In Scope
1. **Detailed Phase Breakdown** - Each of 11 blocks broken into phases
2. **Task Definition** - Create WASM-TASK-002 through WASM-TASK-012 specifications
3. **Success Criteria** - Concrete, measurable outcomes for each block
4. **Validation Gates** - Layer gate requirements (4 gates total)
5. **Dependency Mapping** - Visual dependency graph for all tasks
6. **Resource Planning** - Estimated effort and team allocation
7. **Risk Analysis** - Risks and mitigations for each block

### Out of Scope
- Actual implementation work (belongs in WASM-TASK-002+)
- Detailed code design (covered in knowledge docs and ADRs)
- Tool selection beyond what's already decided in ADRs
- Budget and financial planning (project management concern)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Over-specification
**Impact:** Medium - Could waste time on unnecessary detail  
**Probability:** Low - We have clear ADRs and knowledge docs to guide  
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on actionable subtasks, not design details
- Reference ADRs/knowledge docs instead of duplicating content
- Keep task specs concise and implementation-focused

### Risk 2: Underestimating Complexity
**Impact:** High - Could lead to unrealistic timelines  
**Probability:** Medium - Some blocks are novel implementations  
**Mitigation:**
- Add buffer time to estimates (use ranges, not single numbers)
- Include research/spike phases for uncertain areas
- Plan for iteration and adjustment

### Risk 3: Misaligned Priorities
**Impact:** Medium - Could optimize wrong aspects  
**Probability:** Low - ADR-WASM-010 provides clear priorities  
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize critical path items (Foundation layer)
- Clearly mark CRITICAL tasks (Block 3 Actor Integration)
- Reference ADR-WASM-010 priority guidance

### Risk 4: Incomplete Dependency Mapping
**Impact:** High - Could miss critical dependencies  
**Probability:** Medium - Complex inter-block dependencies  
**Mitigation:**
- Review ADR-WASM-010 dependency graph carefully
- Cross-reference with knowledge docs
- Validate dependencies with team review

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** SKIPPED/NOT_NEEDED - Redundant with Phase 12 validation

**Decision Date:** 2025-10-22

**Why Skipped:**
Phase 12 of WASM-TASK-000 provides comprehensive block readiness assessment (1,049-line validation report) that makes this planning task unnecessary. All planning artifacts already exist in ADR-WASM-010 (dependency graphs, timelines, performance targets). Creating WASM-TASK-001 would duplicate completed work without adding value.

**Impact:**
No negative impact. Project proceeds directly to WASM-TASK-002 (Block 1 Implementation) with complete architectural guidance from Phase 12 validation and ADR-WASM-010 strategy.

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-22: Task Marked SKIPPED/NOT_NEEDED
**Status:** ✅ SKIPPED/NOT_NEEDED

**Decision Rationale:**
This task was originally intended to create a comprehensive implementation roadmap and planning artifacts for Blocks 1-11. However, **Phase 12 of WASM-TASK-000 already accomplished this goal comprehensively:**

1. **Block Readiness Validation Complete**: All 11 implementation blocks validated as 100% ready with:
   - Clear requirements and dependencies documented
   - Integration points clearly defined
   - Error handling complete for all block failure modes
   - Configuration types available for all block settings

2. **Phase 12 Validation Report (1,049 lines)**: Comprehensive assessment providing:
   - Complete block readiness matrix
   - Quality validation (zero warnings, 363 tests passing, 100% rustdoc)
   - Export validation (59 public types properly exported)
   - Standards compliance verification (workspace standards, Microsoft Rust Guidelines)

3. **Planning Already Exists in ADR-WASM-010**:
   - Dependency graphs (ASCII diagram, lines 447-522)
   - Timeline estimates (11-15 months, 53-64 weeks)
   - Performance targets for each block
   - Critical path identified (Layer 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
   - Parallel work opportunities documented

**What This Means:**
- Creating WASM-TASK-001 would duplicate work already completed in Phase 12
- The "planning overhead" is not justified given comprehensive validation already done
- Project is ready to proceed directly to **WASM-TASK-002** (Block 1: Component Loading & Instantiation)

**Key Learning:** When a previous phase (like WASM-TASK-000 Phase 12) provides comprehensive readiness validation, additional planning tasks become redundant. Evidence-based assessment shows all prerequisites for implementation are met.

**Next Action:** Begin WASM-TASK-002 (Block 1 Implementation) - architecture validated, abstractions ready, dependencies clear.

## Notes

**Critical Insight from ADR-WASM-010:**  
Actor System Integration (Block 3, WASM-TASK-004) is FOUNDATIONAL, not an integration layer component. This is properly emphasized in WASM-TASK-004 specification. Blocks 5, 7, and 9 all depend on Block 3.

**Mental Model Reinforced:**  
"Actor-hosted WASM components from the start" (NOT "WASM components, then integrate actors later")

**Task Naming Convention:**  
- Task files: `task_NNN_block_N_descriptive_name.md`
- Task IDs: `[WASM-TASK-NNN]`
- Follows airssys-rt pattern for consistency

**Completion Notes (2025-10-22):**
- **Planning time:** 1 day (2025-10-20) for all 11 task specifications
- **Total documentation:** ~7,000 lines of comprehensive task specifications
- **Phase 5-6 removed:** Unnecessary artifact creation phases eliminated
- **Essential planning:** All dependency graphs, timelines, and resource planning exist in ADR-WASM-010
- **Next step:** Begin WASM-TASK-002 (Block 1: WASM Runtime Layer) implementation

**Estimated Total Implementation Time:** 11-15 months (53-64 weeks per ADR-WASM-010)
- Layer 1 (Foundation): 11-15 weeks
- Layer 2 (Core Services): 20-24 weeks
- Layer 3 (Integration): 9-11 weeks
- Layer 4 (Developer Experience): 9-11 weeks
