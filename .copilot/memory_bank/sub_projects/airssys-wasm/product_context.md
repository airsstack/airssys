# airssys-wasm Product Context

## Problem Statement
Modern applications require pluggable architectures, but traditional plugin systems suffer from security vulnerabilities, platform dependencies, and complex integration challenges. Native plugins can compromise entire systems, while container-based approaches are resource-intensive.

## Why airssys-wasm Exists
`airssys-wasm` leverages WebAssembly's unique combination of security, performance, and portability to create a superior pluggable system. It provides true isolation with deny-by-default security while enabling polyglot composition and near-native performance.

## Target Use Cases

### Secure Plugin Systems
- Applications requiring third-party extensions with security guarantees
- Serverless function execution with multi-tenant isolation
- Edge computing with secure code execution
- Microservice architectures with composable components

### Polyglot Application Development
- Mixed-language applications with WASM component integration
- Legacy system integration through WASM wrappers
- Cross-platform component sharing and reuse
- Language-agnostic API implementations

### AirsSys Ecosystem Enhancement
- Secure extensions for airssys-osl system operations
- Actor-based component hosting through airssys-rt integration
- Pluggable system monitoring and management tools
- Custom business logic components with system integration

## User Experience Goals

### Developer Experience
- **Simple Component Model**: Intuitive component development and composition
- **Language Freedom**: Support for any WASM-compatible language
- **Rich Tooling**: Integration with standard WASM development tools
- **Fast Iteration**: Hot-reloading and rapid development cycles

### Security Experience
- **Transparent Security**: Clear visibility into component capabilities and permissions
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Precise control over component system access
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all component operations
