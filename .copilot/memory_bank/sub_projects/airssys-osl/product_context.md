# airssys-osl Product Context

## Problem Statement
Modern system programming requires direct interaction with operating system primitives, but this comes with significant risks:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Direct OS calls can expose applications to security threats
- **Platform Inconsistencies**: Different operating systems provide different APIs and behaviors
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: Most OS operations lack comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Error-Prone Operations**: Low-level system programming is susceptible to memory safety and resource management errors
- **Complexity Overhead**: Applications must implement security, logging, and cross-platform compatibility repeatedly

## Why airssys-osl Exists
`airssys-osl` addresses these challenges by providing a secure, cross-platform, and well-instrumented abstraction layer over operating system functionality. It enables applications to perform system-level operations safely while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and enforcing security policies.
