# airssys-osl Tech Context

## Technology Stack

### Core Language
- **Rust 2021 Edition**: Memory safety, performance, and cross-platform support
- **Target MSRV**: 1.75+ (stable async/await ecosystem)
- **Compilation Targets**: x86_64 and aarch64 for Linux, macOS, Windows

### Primary Dependencies

#### Async Runtime
```toml
tokio = { version = "1.47", features = ["full"] }
futures = { version = "0.3" }
async-trait = { version = "0.1" }
```

#### System Programming
```toml
nix = { version = "0.27", features = ["process", "fs", "net"] }  # Unix systems
windows-sys = { version = "0.52" }                              # Windows systems
libc = { version = "0.2" }                                      # Low-level C bindings
```

#### Security and Logging
```toml
tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["async-await"] }
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3" }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_yaml = { version = "0.9" }                               # Policy configuration
```

#### Error Handling
```toml
thiserror = { version = "1.0" }
anyhow = { version = "1.0" }                                   # Error context
```

#### Time and Serialization
```toml
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }            # Workspace standard ยง3.2
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
```

### Development Dependencies
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
tokio-test = { version = "0.4" }
tempfile = { version = "3.0" }
assert_matches = { version = "1.5" }
proptest = { version = "1.0" }                                # Property-based testing
criterion = { version = "0.5" }                               # Benchmarking
```
