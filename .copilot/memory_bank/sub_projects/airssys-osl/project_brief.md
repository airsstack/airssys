# airssys-osl Project Brief

## Project Overview
`airssys-osl` (OS Layer Framework) is the foundational component of the AirsSys system programming suite, responsible for handling all low-level operating system interactions with enhanced activity logging and robust security policies.

## Project Goals
1. **Comprehensive OS Abstraction**: Provide high-level, safe interfaces to low-level OS operations
2. **Security-First Design**: Implement deny-by-default security policies with comprehensive audit trails
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems
4. **Performance Excellence**: Minimize overhead while maintaining safety and security
5. **Activity Transparency**: Log all system operations for security and debugging purposes

## Core Responsibilities

### Filesystem Management
- File and directory operations with permission checking
- Path validation and canonicalization
- File monitoring and event notification
- Secure temporary file management
- Archive and compression utilities

### Process Management
- Process spawning and lifecycle management
- Environment variable handling
- Signal management and inter-process communication
- Resource monitoring and limits enforcement
- Process isolation and sandboxing

### Network Management
- Socket creation and management
- Network interface enumeration
- Secure network communication primitives
- Bandwidth monitoring and throttling
- Network policy enforcement

### Utils Management
- External program execution (docker, gh CLI, etc.)
- Command validation and sandboxing
- Output capture and processing
- Timeout and resource limit enforcement
- Secure credential handling for external tools

## Technical Requirements

### Security Requirements
- All operations must be logged with structured activity logs
- Implement configurable security policies
- Support principle of least privilege
- Provide secure defaults for all operations
- Include threat detection and response capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- Minimize system call overhead
- Efficient resource pooling and reuse
- Asynchronous operation support where beneficial
- Memory usage optimization
- Scalable concurrent operation handling

### Reliability Requirements
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive input validation
- Resource leak prevention
- Deterministic behavior under load
- Extensive testing coverage (>95%)

## Architecture Constraints
- Must follow workspace standards (ยง2.1, ยง3.2, ยง4.3, ยง5.1)
- Rust-based implementation using safe abstractions
- Zero unsafe code blocks without thorough justification
- Comprehensive error handling using structured error types
- Async-first design for I/O operations

## Integration Points
- **airssys-rt**: Provide process primitives for actor lifecycle management
- **airssys-wasm**: Supply isolation primitives for WASM component sandboxing
- **External Systems**: Integration with system logging, monitoring, and security tools

## Success Criteria
- Zero memory safety violations
- All security policies configurable and enforceable
- Complete activity logging for all operations
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- Successful integration with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm
