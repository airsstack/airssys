## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Next - Q4 2025)
#### üîÑ In Progress
*Currently completing memory bank setup*

#### ‚è≥ Planned - Priority 1 (Critical Path)
- **Core Module Structure**: Implement basic module hierarchy and interfaces
- **Security Framework**: Design and implement security policy engine
- **Activity Logging System**: Implement comprehensive operation logging
- **Error Handling Framework**: Structured error types and handling patterns

#### ‚è≥ Planned - Priority 2
- **Filesystem Operations**: Basic file and directory operations with security
- **Process Management**: Process spawning and lifecycle management
- **Configuration System**: Security policy and operation configuration
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit and integration test framework

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Q1 2026)
#### ‚è≥ Planned
- **Network Operations**: Socket management and network primitives
- **External Tools Integration**: Docker, GitHub CLI, and other tool integration
- **Resource Management**: Advanced resource pooling and limiting
- **Performance Optimization**: Zero-copy operations and async optimization

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (Q2 2026)
#### ‚è≥ Planned
- **airssys-rt Integration**: Process primitives for actor system
- **airssys-wasm Integration**: Security primitives for WASM sandboxing
- **Monitoring Integration**: Metrics, tracing, and health check systems
- **Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive user and API documentation

## Current Blockers
*None identified - project in early planning phase*

## Known Issues
*None identified - project not yet implemented*

## Architecture Decisions Needed

### High Priority Decisions
1. **Security Policy Format**: Define YAML schema for security policies
2. **Logging Framework Selection**: Choose between tracing, log, or custom implementation
3. **Platform Abstraction Strategy**: Define trait boundaries for platform-specific code
4. **Resource Management Approach**: Design resource pooling and limiting architecture

### Medium Priority Decisions
1. **Metrics Collection Strategy**: Define performance metrics and collection approach
2. **Testing Strategy Details**: Specific testing frameworks and patterns
3. **Documentation Generation**: Automated documentation generation approach
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and deployment strategy

## Performance Baseline
*To be established during Phase 1 implementation*

### Target Metrics
- File operations: <1ms latency for basic operations
- Process spawning: <10ms for simple processes
- Memory usage: Bounded growth under load
- CPU overhead: <1% under normal operation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-Platform Complexity**: Managing platform-specific implementations
- **Security Policy Design**: Balancing security with usability
- **Performance Overhead**: Maintaining low overhead with comprehensive logging
- **Integration Complexity**: Seamless integration with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Platform Testing**: Comprehensive testing on all target platforms
- **Security Review**: Regular security architecture reviews
- **Performance Testing**: Continuous performance benchmarking
- **Integration Testing**: Early and frequent integration testing

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >95% code coverage
- **Security Audit**: Pass comprehensive security review
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet all performance targets
- **Documentation Completeness**: Full API and architectural documentation

### Integration Metrics
- **AirsSys Integration**: Successful integration with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm
- **External Tool Support**: Reliable integration with docker, gh CLI, etc.
- **Monitoring Integration**: Seamless integration with monitoring systems
- **Compliance Support**: Meet enterprise compliance requirements
