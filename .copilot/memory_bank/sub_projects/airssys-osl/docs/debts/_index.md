## Debt Prevention Strategy

### Early Stage Prevention
- Follow workspace standards (ยง2.1, ยง3.2, ยง4.3, ยง5.1) from day one
- Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning
- Security-first design to prevent security debt
- Document all architectural decisions to prevent knowledge debt

### Monitoring Strategy
- Regular code reviews with debt identification
- Automated tools for detecting potential debt (clippy, security scanners)
- Performance benchmarks to identify performance debt
- Documentation coverage analysis

### Remediation Planning
- Reserve 20% of development time for debt remediation
- Prioritize security and architectural debt highest
- Regular debt review meetings during development
- Integration with GitHub issues for tracking

## Expected Debt Categories

### Anticipated DEBT-ARCH
- Cross-platform compatibility shortcuts during initial development
- Security policy complexity reductions for MVP
- Integration complexity with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm

### Anticipated DEBT-QUALITY
- Error handling simplifications during rapid prototyping
- Testing coverage gaps during initial implementation
- Code duplication during platform-specific implementations

### Anticipated DEBT-PERF
- Non-optimized implementations during feature development
- Resource management optimizations deferred for functionality
- Async optimization deferred during initial async implementation

## Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly:** New debt identification during development
- **Monthly:** Debt prioritization and remediation planning
- **Quarterly:** Strategic debt review and prevention strategy updates

### Update Triggers
- New technical debt identified during development
- Debt items resolved or status changes
- Priority reassessments based on project needs
- Integration testing reveals new debt areas

### Index Maintenance
- **Owner:** airssys-osl lead developer
- **Backup:** AirsSys project maintainer
- **Next Review:** When development begins
