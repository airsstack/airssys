## Active Debt Items

### DEBT-002: Framework-Core Integration Gap ⭐
**Category:** DEBT-ARCH  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** 2025-10-04  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (split across OSL-TASK-007, 008)  

**Summary:** Framework layer doesn't integrate with core abstractions. Operations bypass Operation trait, OSExecutor, and middleware pipeline.

**Resolution Strategy:**
- OSL-TASK-007: Concrete operation types (2-3 days)
- OSL-TASK-008: Platform executors (3-4 days)  
- OSL-TASK-006 Final Wiring: Framework integration (2-3 hours)

**Related Documentation:**
- KNOW-004: Framework-Core Integration Pattern
- KNOW-005: Framework OSExecutor Usage
- OSL-TASK-007, OSL-TASK-008

**Timeline:** Resolution expected by end of Q4 2025

### DEBT-001: Generic Constraint Design Pattern
**Category:** DEBT-QUALITY  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** 2025-09-27  
**Resolved:** 2025-09-29  

**Original Issue:** Initial design used dyn trait objects, violating M-DI-HIERARCHY guideline.

**Resolution:** Redesigned all core traits to use generic constraints instead of dyn patterns.

**Related:** ADR-025, KNOW-002

## Debt Prevention Strategy

### Early Stage Prevention
- Follow workspace standards (§2.1, §3.2, §4.3, §5.1) from day one
- Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning
- Security-first design to prevent security debt
- Document all architectural decisions to prevent knowledge debt

### Monitoring Strategy
- Regular code reviews with debt identification
- Automated tools for detecting potential debt (clippy, security scanners)
- Performance benchmarks to identify performance debt
- Documentation coverage analysis

### Remediation Planning
- Reserve 20% of development time for debt remediation
- Prioritize security and architectural debt highest
- Regular debt review meetings during development
- Integration with GitHub issues for tracking

## Expected Debt Categories

### Anticipated DEBT-ARCH
- Cross-platform compatibility shortcuts during initial development
- Security policy complexity reductions for MVP
- Integration complexity with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm

### Anticipated DEBT-QUALITY
- Error handling simplifications during rapid prototyping
- Testing coverage gaps during initial implementation
- Code duplication during platform-specific implementations

### Anticipated DEBT-PERF
- Non-optimized implementations during feature development
- Resource management optimizations deferred for functionality
- Async optimization deferred during initial async implementation

## Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly:** New debt identification during development
- **Monthly:** Debt prioritization and remediation planning
- **Quarterly:** Strategic debt review and prevention strategy updates

### Update Triggers
- New technical debt identified during development
- Debt items resolved or status changes
- Priority reassessments based on project needs
- Integration testing reveals new debt areas

### Index Maintenance
- **Owner:** airssys-osl lead developer
- **Backup:** AirsSys project maintainer
- **Next Review:** When development begins
