# airssys-osl Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Foundation Setup and Architecture Design  
**Sprint:** Memory Bank Setup and Initial Planning  
**Priority:** High - Foundation component for entire AirsSys ecosystem

## Recent Changes
### 2025-09-27
- **Memory Bank Established**: Complete memory bank structure created for airssys-osl
- **Project Architecture Defined**: Core responsibilities and integration points established
- **Documentation Framework**: Technical documentation system implemented
- **Workspace Standards Applied**: Full compliance with workspace standards framework

## Current Work Items
1. **Memory Bank Completion**: Finish remaining core memory bank files
2. **Architecture Planning**: Define detailed system architecture and component structure
3. **Security Framework Design**: Design comprehensive security policy and logging system
4. **Technology Selection**: Finalize specific dependencies and implementation technologies

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**: Finish all remaining memory bank files and task structure
2. **Create Initial ADR**: Document core architectural decisions for the OS layer framework
3. **Design Security Model**: Define security policy structure and activity logging framework
4. **Plan Implementation Phases**: Break down development into manageable phases

## Decisions Made
- **Security-First Approach**: All operations will include comprehensive logging and security policy enforcement
- **Cross-Platform Priority**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows as primary targets
- **Async-First Design**: Use async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- **Zero Unsafe Code Goal**: Minimize unsafe code blocks with thorough justification required

## Pending Decisions
- **Specific Dependency Selection**: Choose exact versions and features for core dependencies
- **Logging Framework**: Select specific logging implementation (tracing vs log vs custom)
- **Security Policy Format**: Define configuration format for security policies
- **External Tool Integration**: Specific approach for docker/gh CLI integration patterns

## Current Challenges
*None identified - project in early planning phase*

## Context for Next Session
- Memory bank structure is complete and ready for active development
- Need to begin concrete architecture and implementation planning
- Security framework design is critical path item
- Integration points with airssys-rt and airssys-wasm need definition

## Recent Insights
- Memory bank system provides excellent structure for managing complex system programming project
- Security-first design requires careful balance between usability and safety
- Cross-platform consistency will be a significant architectural challenge
- Activity logging system will be crucial for both security and debugging

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project structure and documentation framework established
- âœ… Clear project scope and objectives defined
- âœ… Integration points with other AirsSys components identified
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin detailed architectural design and implementation planning
