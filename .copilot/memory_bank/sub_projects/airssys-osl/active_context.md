# airssys-osl Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** OSL-TASK-009 COMPLETE - Architecture Refactoring Complete
**Sprint:** Ready for Next Development Phase
**Priority:** High - Foundation complete at 95%, ready for advanced features

## Recent Changes
### 2025-10-09
- **OSL-TASK-009 COMPLETED**: Full architecture refactoring successfully completed
- **Phase 1 COMPLETED**: Framework code removed (~2270 lines eliminated)
- **Phase 2 COMPLETED**: Helper functions module with 10 ergonomic APIs
- **Phase 3 COMPLETED**: Middleware extension trait (ExecutorExt pattern)
- **Phase 4 COMPLETED**: Documentation updated (lib.rs, executors/mod.rs, operations/mod.rs)
- **Phase 5 COMPLETED**: README and examples updated
  - Updated README.md with helper function examples and middleware usage
  - Created helper_functions.rs example (demonstrates all 10 helper functions)
  - Created middleware_extension.rs example (3 middleware scenarios)
  - Verified all 7 existing examples still work
- **Phase 6 COMPLETED**: Final validation passed
  - 236 total tests passing (176 unit + 60 integration)
  - Zero clippy warnings in airssys-osl
  - Rustdoc and mdBook build successfully
  - All examples tested and working
- **Quality Gates**: All production-ready standards met
- **Progress**: 95% complete (OSL-TASK-009 done)

### Completed Tasks
- **OSL-TASK-002**: Complete logger middleware implementation âœ…
- **OSL-TASK-007**: All 11 concrete operations implemented âœ…
- **OSL-TASK-008**: All 3 platform executors implemented âœ…
- **OSL-TASK-009**: Architecture refactoring complete âœ…

## Current Work Items
No active tasks - ready for next phase

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Identify Next Task**: Review remaining 5% and prioritize next development task
2. **Consider**: Security policy implementation, advanced middleware, or integration features

## Decisions Made
- **Security-First Approach**: All operations will include comprehensive logging and security policy enforcement
- **Cross-Platform Priority**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows as primary targets
- **Async-First Design**: Use async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- **Zero Unsafe Code Goal**: Minimize unsafe code blocks with thorough justification required
- **Generic-First Logger Design**: LoggerMiddleware<L: ActivityLogger> for zero-cost abstractions
- **Separated Concerns**: Pure ActivityLogger trait with specific implementation variants
- **Module Architecture**: Complete src/middleware/logger/ hierarchy following Â§4.3 standards

## Pending Decisions
- **Specific Dependency Selection**: Choose exact versions and features for core dependencies
- **Logging Framework**: Select specific logging implementation (tracing vs log vs custom)
- **Security Policy Format**: Define configuration format for security policies
- **External Tool Integration**: Specific approach for docker/gh CLI integration patterns
- **Logger Configuration Schema**: Define LoggerConfig structure and default values
- **File Logger Rotation**: Specific approach for log file rotation and retention policies

## Current Challenges
- **ActivityLog Design**: Balance between comprehensive metadata and performance overhead
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Ensure logger errors don't impact operation execution
- **Async Performance**: Optimize async logging to avoid blocking operation execution
- **Tracing Integration**: Seamless integration with existing tracing infrastructure

## Context for Next Session
- OSL-TASK-002 Phase 1 complete: Module structure ready for implementation
- Need to implement core types (ActivityLog, ActivityLogger, config) in Phase 2
- Logger middleware design validated through successful module structure
- Ready to begin concrete implementation with all dependencies available

## Recent Insights
- Memory bank system provides excellent structure for managing complex system programming project
- Security-first design requires careful balance between usability and safety
- Cross-platform consistency will be a significant architectural challenge
- Activity logging system will be crucial for both security and debugging

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project structure and documentation framework established
- âœ… Clear project scope and objectives defined
- âœ… Integration points with other AirsSys components identified
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin detailed architectural design and implementation planning
