```

## Actor Model Architecture

### Performance Targets
- **Actor Capacity**: 10,000+ concurrent actors per system
- **Message Throughput**: 1M+ messages/second under optimal conditions
- **Message Latency**: <1ms for local message delivery
- **Memory Per Actor**: <1KB baseline memory overhead
- **CPU Overhead**: <5% runtime overhead for actor management

### Actor Lifecycle Management
- **Spawn Time**: <100μs for basic actor creation
- **Message Processing**: Sequential, one-at-a-time processing per actor
- **State Management**: Private, encapsulated state per actor
- **Failure Recovery**: Supervisor-managed restart within 10ms

## Concurrency Model

### Tokio Integration
- **Runtime**: Single or multi-threaded Tokio runtime
- **Task Scheduling**: Cooperative scheduling with async/await
- **I/O Integration**: Non-blocking I/O through Tokio ecosystem
- **Resource Management**: Async-aware resource pooling and management

### Message Passing Implementation
- **Channel Type**: mpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) per actor
- **Message Serialization**: Zero-copy where possible, serde for complex types
- **Backpressure**: Bounded mailboxes with configurable overflow strategies
- **Routing**: Hash-based routing for distributed message delivery

## Fault Tolerance Architecture

### Supervisor Tree Design
- **Supervision Strategies**: OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne
- **Restart Policies**: Permanent, Temporary, Transient actors
- **Escalation**: Hierarchical fault escalation up supervisor tree
- **Circuit Breakers**: Built-in circuit breaker for external service integration

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Actor Failures**: Isolated failures with supervisor intervention
- **System Failures**: Graceful degradation with partial system operation
- **Recovery**: Automatic restart with configurable backoff strategies
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive failure tracking and alerting

## Integration Points

### airssys-osl Integration
- **Process Management**: Use OSL for actual OS process operations
- **Security Context**: Inherit security policies from OSL layer
- **Resource Management**: Coordinate with OSL resource limits
- **Activity Logging**: Integrate with OSL logging framework

### airssys-wasm Integration (Planned)
- **Component Hosting**: Actors can host WASM components
- **Lifecycle Management**: Supervisor management of WASM component lifecycle
- **Message Bridging**: Message passing between actors and WASM components
- **Resource Isolation**: Actor-level isolation for WASM components

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- **Actor Pooling**: Reuse actor instances for common patterns
- **Message Pooling**: Object pooling for frequently used message types
- **Zero-Copy Messaging**: Arc-based sharing for large message payloads
- **Compact Representation**: Efficient memory layout for actor state

### CPU Optimization
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Crossbeam for high-performance concurrent operations
- **Batch Processing**: Message batch processing where beneficial
- **SIMD Optimization**: Vectorized operations for numerical workloads
- **Work Stealing**: Tokio work-stealing scheduler integration

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **Actor Metrics**: Actor count, message throughput, processing latency
- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU utilization, supervisor activity
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific metrics through metrics crate
- **Performance Profiling**: Integration with standard Rust profiling tools

### Tracing and Logging
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for message flow tracing
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-structured logs for automated analysis
- **Actor Tracing**: Individual actor execution tracing and debugging
