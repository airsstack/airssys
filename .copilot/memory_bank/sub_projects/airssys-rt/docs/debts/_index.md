## Anticipated Debt Categories

### Expected DEBT-ARCH  
- Actor state management simplifications during initial implementation
- Message routing optimizations deferred for basic functionality
- Supervisor tree complexity reductions for MVP

### Expected DEBT-PERF
- Message serialization optimizations deferred
- Memory pooling implementations postponed
- Actor scheduling optimizations delayed

### Expected DEBT-QUALITY
- Error handling simplifications in actor boundaries
- Testing coverage gaps during rapid development
- Documentation gaps for complex actor patterns

### Debt Prevention Strategy
- Follow workspace standards (ยง2.1, ยง3.2, ยง4.3, ยง5.1) from start
- Implement comprehensive testing early
- Regular performance benchmarking
- Continuous integration with debt detection
