# Refactoring Decision Summary - October 6, 2025

## What Happened Today

### Morning: RT-TASK-006 Phase 2 Development
- Started implementing `actor_system.rs`
- Hit 10+ compilation errors
- Discovered architecture mismatch between knowledge docs and actual APIs

### Afternoon: Deep Investigation
- User requested: "explore and observe every documentation file in this project's memory bank"
- Reviewed all related knowledge docs, ADRs, and task files
- Multiple rounds of architectural discussion (12+ exchanges)
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: MessageBroker MUST be pub-sub, not direct routing

### Evening: Documentation & Planning
- Created ADR-006: MessageBroker Pub-Sub Architecture
- Created KNOWLEDGE-RT-012: Pub-Sub MessageBroker Pattern (600+ lines)
- Updated DEBT-RT-005 with complete pub-sub analysis
- Created RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR and RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB task files
- Updated progress tracking and created roadmap

## The Decision

### ❌ What We Were Doing
- Implementing RT-TASK-006 Phase 2 (ActorSystem)
- Using direct routing broker API (send/request)
- Hitting compilation errors due to architecture mismatch

### ✅ What We're Doing Now
- **PAUSE** RT-TASK-006 Phase 2
- **SWITCH** to RT-TASK-004 refactoring (pub-sub architecture)
- **TWO NEW TASKS**:
  1. RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR: Update trait definition (2-3 hours)
  2. RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB: Implement pub-sub (3-4 hours)
- **RESUME** RT-TASK-006 Phase 2 after refactoring complete

---

## Why This Makes Sense

### Technical Reasons
1. **Extensibility**: Need hooks for logging, metrics, persistence
2. **Monitoring**: Multiple subscribers (routing, metrics, audit)
3. **Dead Letters**: Undeliverable messages need separate handling
4. **Distributed**: Future Redis/NATS brokers without changing actors
5. **Testability**: Easier to mock pub-sub streams than direct routing

### Strategic Reasons
1. **Foundation**: Pub-sub is architectural foundation for all messaging
2. **Once Only**: Refactor now, never again
3. **Clean Break**: Two focused tasks, clear deliverables
4. **Low Risk**: Incremental changes, backward compatible
5. **High Value**: Unlocks many future features

### Workspace Standards Alignment
- **§6.1 (YAGNI)**: We NEED pub-sub for monitoring (immediate requirement)
- **§6.2 (Avoid dyn)**: Using generic constraints, not trait objects
- **§6.3 (M-DI-HIERARCHY)**: Concrete types > generics > dyn

## What We're Building

### Current Architecture (Wrong)
```
Actor → ActorContext.send() → Broker.send() → Registry.resolve() → Mailbox
                                    ↓
                            (Direct routing - tight coupling)
```

### New Architecture (Correct)
```
Actor → ActorContext.send() → Broker.publish() → [Message Bus]
                                                       ↓
                                              Broker.subscribe()
                                                       ↓
                                           ActorSystem (router)
                                                       ↓
                                           Registry.resolve()
                                                       ↓
                                              Actor Mailbox

                              [Other Subscribers]
                                      ↓
                                  Monitor
                                  Audit
                                  Dead Letter Queue
```

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR (Trait Definition)
**File:** `tasks/task_004_refactor_pubsub_trait.md`  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Do FIRST

**Changes:**
- Add `MessageStream<M>` type
- Add `publish()` method
- Add `subscribe()` method  
- Add `publish_request()` method
- Update trait documentation
- Deprecate old methods

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Clean pub-sub API defined
- ⚠️ InMemoryMessageBroker won't compile (expected)

---

### Task 2: RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB (Implementation)
**File:** `tasks/task_004_pubsub_implementation.md`  
**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Do SECOND

**Changes:**
- Add subscriber management (`RwLock<Vec<Sender>>`)
- Implement `subscribe()` - register subscribers
- Implement `publish()` - broadcast to all subscribers
- Add extensibility hooks (logging, metrics placeholders)
- Handle subscriber cleanup

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Full pub-sub implementation
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Ready for ActorSystem integration

---

## Timeline

### Today (Oct 6, 2025)
- ✅ Architecture breakthrough
- ✅ Documentation complete (ADR-006, KNOWLEDGE-RT-012, tasks)
- ✅ Decision made: refactor first, resume later

### Tomorrow (Oct 7, 2025)
- 🔲 RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR (2-3 hours)
- 🔲 RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB start (partial)

### Day After (Oct 8, 2025)
- 🔲 RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB complete
- 🔲 RT-TASK-006 Phase 2 resume

**Total:** 5-7 hours refactoring, then back to normal development

## Impact Assessment

### What Stays the Same
✅ ActorRegistry - no changes (perfect as-is)  
✅ BrokerError - no changes  
✅ Message system - no changes  
✅ Mailbox system - no changes  
✅ Actor traits - no changes  

### What Changes
🔄 MessageBroker trait - add pub-sub methods  
🔄 InMemoryMessageBroker - add subscriber management  
🔄 ActorSystem - subscribe and route (future)  
🔄 ActorContext - use publish() (future)  

### Backward Compatibility
✅ Old methods deprecated, forward to new methods  
✅ Existing tests continue to work  
✅ No breaking changes during transition  

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Broker trait extension (adding methods, not changing)
- Subscriber management (standard pattern)
- Two-task approach (incremental progress)

### Medium Risk
- Performance impact (expected <1-2μs per message)
- Testing pub-sub patterns (new test suite needed)

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive test suite (~15 new tests)
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- Incremental implementation (can stop/review)

---

## Success Criteria

### After Refactoring Complete
- [ ] MessageBroker trait has publish/subscribe methods
- [ ] InMemoryMessageBroker implements pub-sub
- [ ] All broker tests passing (~24 tests)
- [ ] Zero compilation errors
- [ ] Zero clippy warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated

### After RT-TASK-006 Resume
- [ ] ActorSystem subscribes to broker
- [ ] Message router task working
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Dead letter queue implemented
- [ ] All system tests passing (~50 tests)

## Communication

### What to Say
"We discovered the MessageBroker needs to be a pub-sub message bus instead of direct routing. This is a foundational architecture decision that enables monitoring, distributed brokers, and dead letter queues. We're doing a focused 5-7 hour refactoring in two tasks, then resuming ActorSystem development with the correct architecture."

### Why It's Good
- **Honest**: We found an architecture issue and fixing it properly
- **Proactive**: Better to fix now than after more code depends on it
- **Low Cost**: 5-7 hours refactoring vs. weeks of technical debt later
- **High Value**: Unlocks many future capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight/Tomorrow)
1. Review RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR task file
2. Read KNOWLEDGE-RT-012 implementation guide
3. Start implementing MessageStream type
4. Work through trait refactoring phases

### This Week
1. Complete RT-TASK-004-REFACTOR (2-3 hours)
2. Complete RT-TASK-004-PUBSUB (3-4 hours)
3. Resume RT-TASK-006 Phase 2 (4-5 hours)

### Outcome
- ✅ Solid pub-sub architecture
- ✅ ActorSystem with message router
- ✅ Ready for supervisor trees
- ✅ Foundation for distributed messaging
