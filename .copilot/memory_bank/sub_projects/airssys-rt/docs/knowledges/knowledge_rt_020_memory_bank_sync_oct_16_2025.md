# KNOWLEDGE-RT-020: Memory Bank Synchronization (Oct 16, 2025)

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Type:** Maintenance Documentation  
**Purpose:** Record comprehensive memory bank synchronization to resolve RT-TASK-009 abandonment inconsistencies

## Context

After RT-TASK-009 (OSL Integration) was abandoned on October 15, 2025, several memory bank files contained outdated references suggesting the task was still active or required for other tasks. This created confusion about:
1. What tasks RT-TASK-011 (Documentation) actually depends on
2. The current state of RT-TASK-009 (abandoned vs. active)
3. The distinction between RT-TASK-010 (Universal Monitoring - COMPLETE) and references to abandoned OSL work

## Synchronization Scope

### Files Updated (Oct 16, 2025)

#### 1. **tasks/task_011_documentation_completion.md**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated dependencies section to clarify:
  - RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-007: Complete ✅
  - RT-TASK-010 (Universal Monitoring): Complete ✅
  - RT-TASK-013 (Supervisor Builder): Complete ✅
  - RT-TASK-008 (Performance Baseline): Pending ⏳ (not blocking)
  - RT-TASK-009 (OSL Integration): ABANDONED ❌ (removed from dependencies)
- ✅ Updated scope to remove OSL/WASM integration documentation
- ✅ Updated subtask 11.11: "Integration examples" → "Actor pattern examples"
- ✅ Updated mdBook structure: removed `integration.md`, added `monitoring.md`
- ✅ Added progress log entry documenting the sync (Oct 16, 2025)

**Impact:** RT-TASK-011 now correctly reflects that it documents only the core actor runtime, not OSL integration.

#### 2. **tasks/_index.md**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated header metadata:
  - Last Updated: 2025-10-16
  - Total Tasks: 13 active (was 15, RT-TASK-009 abandoned)
  - Completed Tasks: 8 (added RT-TASK-013)
  - Removed RT-TASK-009 from "Ready for Implementation"
  - Added "Abandoned Tasks" section
- ✅ Removed "NEXT PRIORITY DECISION" between RT-TASK-008 and RT-TASK-009
- ✅ Made RT-TASK-008 the clear next priority (no longer "Option A")
- ✅ Updated RT-TASK-008 scope to reflect baseline-first strategy (Oct 15 revision)
- ✅ Moved RT-TASK-013 from "Planned" to "Complete" in Phase 1
- ✅ Added Phase 3 section marking RT-TASK-009 as ❌ ABANDONED with details
- ✅ Updated Phase 4 to clarify RT-TASK-011 scope (no OSL docs)
- ✅ Updated task categories and timeline estimates
- ✅ Added progress status: ~85% complete (8 of 9 active tasks)
- ✅ Noted time saved by abandoning RT-TASK-009 (~10-14 days)

**Impact:** Task index now accurately reflects project status and removes confusion about next steps.

#### 3. **current_context.md**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated header:
  - Last Updated: 2025-10-16
  - Status: Foundation Complete - RT-TASK-008 Ready
  - Current Phase: Performance Baseline Measurement
- ✅ Removed all RT-TASK-009 Phase 2 completion references
- ✅ Added RT-TASK-013 completion summary
- ✅ Added OSL Integration Abandonment section with details
- ✅ Updated "What's Been Done" to include all 9 completed tasks plus RT-TASK-009 (abandoned)
- ✅ Updated immediate next steps to RT-TASK-008 (4 days)

**Impact:** Current context now accurately reflects Oct 16, 2025 state, not outdated Oct 14 OSL work.

#### 4. **docs/knowledges/_index.md**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Marked KNOWLEDGE-RT-017 (OSL Integration Actors) as:
  - Status: ❌ ABANDONED (Oct 15, 2025)
  - Category: Integration Patterns (HISTORICAL - NOT IMPLEMENTED)
  - Updated summary with strikethrough and abandonment note
- ✅ Updated Integration Category to mark OSL integration as ABANDONED
- ✅ Updated Task Sequencing Strategy section to show RT-TASK-010/007 as COMPLETED
- ✅ Added "Abandoned Integration" section documenting RT-TASK-009 abandonment

**Impact:** Knowledge index now clearly marks OSL-related knowledge as historical reference only.

## Clarifications Established

### Task Status Clarity

**Completed Tasks (8):**
1. ✅ RT-TASK-001: Message System Implementation
2. ✅ RT-TASK-002: Actor System Core
3. ✅ RT-TASK-003: Mailbox System
4. ✅ RT-TASK-004: Message Broker Core
5. ✅ RT-TASK-005: Actor Addressing
6. ✅ RT-TASK-006: Actor System Framework
7. ✅ RT-TASK-007: Supervisor Framework
8. ✅ RT-TASK-010: Universal Monitoring Infrastructure
9. ✅ RT-TASK-013: Supervisor Builder Pattern

**Active/Pending Tasks (4):**
1. ⏳ RT-TASK-008: Performance Baseline Measurement (NEXT - 4 days)
2. ⏳ RT-TASK-011: Documentation Completion (8 days)
3. ⏳ RT-TASK-012: Comprehensive Testing (10-12 days)
4. ⏳ RT-TASK-014+: Future enhancements (TBD)

**Abandoned Tasks (1):**
1. ❌ RT-TASK-009: OSL Integration (Oct 15, 2025)

### RT-TASK-010 Disambiguation

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**
- **RT-TASK-010 (Universal Monitoring Infrastructure)**: ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 7, 2025)
  - Generic `Monitor<E>` trait
  - `InMemoryMonitor` and `NoopMonitor` implementations
  - 61 monitoring tests passing
  - Used by RT-TASK-007 (Supervisor Framework)
  - This is a REAL, COMPLETED task

- **Confusion Source**: progress.md mentioned "RT-TASK-010 (ABANDONED)" referring to OSL work
  - This was incorrect labeling
  - The REAL RT-TASK-010 is the monitoring system and is COMPLETE
  - OSL-related work was all under RT-TASK-009 (which was abandoned)

### RT-TASK-011 Dependencies

**RT-TASK-011 (Documentation Completion) depends ONLY on:**
- ✅ Core runtime tasks (001-007): All complete
- ✅ RT-TASK-010 (Monitoring): Complete
- ✅ RT-TASK-013 (Builder Pattern): Complete
- ⏳ RT-TASK-008 (Performance Baseline): Pending but NOT blocking (docs can proceed, then add baseline metrics when available)

**RT-TASK-011 does NOT depend on:**
- ❌ RT-TASK-009 (OSL Integration) - Abandoned, removed from scope

### Documentation Scope for RT-TASK-011

**Will Document:**
- ✅ Actor system (lifecycle, traits, spawning)
- ✅ Message passing (broker, mailbox, patterns)
- ✅ Supervision trees (strategies, health monitoring)
- ✅ Monitoring system (events, observers)
- ✅ Builder patterns (supervisor child spawning)
- ✅ Performance characteristics (from RT-TASK-008 when available)

**Will NOT Document:**
- ❌ OSL integration (abandoned)
- ❌ WASM integration (future, out of scope)

## Lessons Learned

### Memory Bank Maintenance

1. **Immediate Sync Required**: When tasks are abandoned, ALL references must be updated immediately
2. **Cross-File Dependencies**: Task abandonment affects: task files, index, current context, knowledge docs, ADRs
3. **Clear Status Markers**: Use ❌ ABANDONED, ✅ COMPLETE, ⏳ PENDING consistently
4. **Historical Preservation**: Keep abandoned work docs with clear markers (don't delete, mark as historical)

### Documentation Standards

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: List all dependencies with status indicators
2. **Scope Clarity**: Clearly state what IS and IS NOT in scope
3. **Progress Logs**: Document all significant changes with dates
4. **Status Tracking**: Maintain accurate completion percentages and timelines

### Project Management

1. **Abandonment Impact**: Removing a major task saves time but requires memory bank sync
2. **Timeline Benefits**: RT-TASK-009 abandonment saved ~10-14 days
3. **Focus Clarity**: Narrower scope (core runtime only) improves clarity and achievability
4. **Dependencies Matter**: Clearly understanding task dependencies prevents confusion
