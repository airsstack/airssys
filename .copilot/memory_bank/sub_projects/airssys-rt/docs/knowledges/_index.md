- **RT-TASK-010**: Monitoring Module - implements patterns from KNOWLEDGE-RT-013 action plans

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task Sequencing Strategy
- **KNOWLEDGE-RT-013**: RT-TASK-010 before RT-TASK-007
  - **Rationale**: Monitoring is foundational infrastructure for supervisor, performance, and system monitoring
  - **Impact**: RT-TASK-007 uses Monitor<SupervisionEvent> from RT-TASK-010
  - **Benefits**: Reduces supervisor complexity, enables reuse, provides zero-overhead option
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete RT-TASK-010 before starting RT-TASK-007
