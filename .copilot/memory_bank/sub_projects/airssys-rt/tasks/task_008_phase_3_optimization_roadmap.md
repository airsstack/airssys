# RT-TASK-008 Phase 3 - Data-Driven Optimization Roadmap

**Created:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Planning Document  
**Purpose:** Document performance optimization opportunities identified from baseline measurement

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 baseline measurement (October 16, 2025) revealed **zero critical performance bottlenecks**. All core operations perform at or significantly exceed target metrics:

- ‚úÖ Message latency: **1,357x faster** than <1ms target (737 ns)
- ‚úÖ Throughput: **4.7x better** than 1M msgs/sec target (4.7M msgs/sec)
- ‚úÖ Actor spawn: **Sub-microsecond** (624.74 ns)
- ‚úÖ Supervision: **Sub-2¬µs** (1.28 ¬µs child spawn)

**Conclusion:** Current architecture requires **no immediate optimization**. Focus development on features and correctness, not performance.

---

## Optimization Philosophy

**YAGNI Compliance:**
- ‚úÖ **Measure first, optimize later**: Baseline established, data-driven decisions
- ‚úÖ **No premature optimization**: All operations already sub-microsecond
- ‚úÖ **Real bottlenecks only**: User business logic, I/O, algorithms (not actor framework)

**When to Optimize:**
- ‚ùå **Don't optimize** actor framework internals without proven need
- ‚úÖ **Do optimize** when profiling shows >5% time in specific framework code path
- ‚úÖ **Do optimize** when user reports actual performance issues with evidence

---

## Optimization Opportunities (Prioritized)

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must fix - blocking production use
- **P1 (High)**: Significant impact, proven bottleneck
- **P2 (Medium)**: Moderate impact, data suggests potential
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor impact, monitor only
- **P4 (Defer)**: Speculative, no evidence of need

---

### P2 (Medium Priority) - Broker Routing Overhead Investigation

**Observed Behavior:**
- **Direct actor processing**: 31.55 ns/message
- **Broker routing**: 211.88 ns/message
- **Overhead**: 180.33 ns (6.7x slower than direct)

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Absolute performance**: 211 ns is still sub-microsecond (excellent)
- **Throughput**: 4.7M msgs/sec sustained (4.7x better than target)
- **Use case**: Pub-sub, decoupling (180 ns overhead is acceptable tradeoff)

**Investigation Tasks:**
1. **Profile broker routing**: Identify hot paths in `InMemoryMessageBroker`
   - Topic lookup overhead
   - Subscription management cost
   - Channel send/receive overhead
2. **Measure breakdown**: 180 ns total, where is it spent?
3. **Evaluate alternatives**: HashMap vs BTreeMap for topics, channel types
4. **Benchmark variations**: Different broker implementations

**Optimization Potential:**
- **Best case**: Reduce overhead to 100 ns (still 3.2x vs direct)
- **Realistic**: Reduce overhead to 150 ns (4.75x vs direct)
- **Outcome**: 4.7M ‚Üí 6.6M msgs/sec (40% improvement)

**Priority Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ **Data-driven**: 6.7x overhead is measurable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not blocking**: 4.7M msgs/sec already exceeds requirements
- üìä **Investigate first**: Profile before optimizing (may not be worth complexity)

**Action Plan:**
1. **Phase 1** (1 day): Profile broker with flamegraph
2. **Phase 2** (1 day): Identify top 3 hot paths
3. **Phase 3** (2 days): Prototype optimizations, benchmark
4. **Phase 4** (1 day): Cost-benefit analysis, decision to implement or defer

**Success Criteria:**
- Reduce broker overhead from 180 ns to <150 ns
- Maintain code clarity and maintainability
- No regressions in other benchmarks

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low risk**: Optimization is isolated to broker module
- **Medium complexity**: May require data structure changes
- **Uncertain benefit**: Users may not notice 40% broker improvement

**Decision Checkpoint:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Defer until proven bottleneck**: Wait for user profiling showing broker is >5% of total time
- ‚úÖ **Alternative**: Document broker overhead, let users choose direct refs for hot paths

---

### P3 (Low Priority) - Message Broadcast Variance Monitoring

**Observed Behavior:**
- **Baseline**: 3.9511 ¬µs to broadcast to 10 actors
- **Variance**: Wide bounds (3.2159-5.0914 ¬µs range)
- **Outliers**: 10% severe outliers (3/30 samples)

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Absolute performance**: <5 ¬µs for 10 subscribers (acceptable)
- **Scaling**: 395 ns per subscriber (reasonable overhead)
- **Variance cause**: Likely Tokio broadcast channel implementation

**Investigation Tasks:**
1. **Monitor trend**: Track outliers across multiple benchmark runs
2. **Profile variance**: Identify if outliers are systematic or random
3. **Evaluate alternatives**: tokio::sync::broadcast vs custom implementation
4. **Test at scale**: Broadcast to 100, 1000 subscribers

**Optimization Potential:**
- **Best case**: Reduce variance, stabilize to 3.5-4.0 ¬µs range
- **Realistic**: Monitor only, no action needed
- **Outcome**: More predictable latency, but absolute time unchanged

**Priority Rationale:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Variance acceptable**: 10% outliers within normal range
- üìä **Monitor only**: No action unless variance increases
- ‚úÖ **Already fast**: 395 ns/subscriber is excellent

**Action Plan:**
1. **Track over time**: Record outlier rate in future benchmark runs
2. **Alert if degraded**: If outliers >20%, investigate
3. **Otherwise**: No action, monitor only

**Success Criteria:**
- Outlier rate <15% (currently 10%)
- Variance range <30% of estimate (currently 29%)

**Decision:**
- ‚úÖ **Monitor only**: Current performance acceptable
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Investigate if**: Outliers >20% or user reports broadcast latency issues

### P3 (Low Priority) - Actor Memory Scaling Beyond 50 Actors

**Observed Behavior:**
- **1 actor**: 718.43 ns allocation time
- **10 actors**: 742.76 ns/actor (+3.4%)
- **50 actors**: 762.68 ns/actor (+6.2%)
- **Trend**: Linear scaling with minor overhead growth

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Absolute overhead**: 6.2% at 50x scale (excellent)
- **Projection**: ~10% at 100 actors, ~15% at 1000 actors (acceptable)
- **Cause**: OS memory allocator fragmentation, page faults

**Investigation Tasks:**
1. **Test at scale**: Benchmark 100, 1000, 10,000 actors
2. **Memory profiling**: Measure actual memory footprint (not just allocation time)
3. **Allocator comparison**: System allocator vs jemalloc, mimalloc
4. **Pool strategies**: Pre-allocated actor pools vs on-demand

**Optimization Potential:**
- **Best case**: Maintain <5% overhead at all scales
- **Realistic**: Keep overhead <10% up to 10,000 actors
- **Outcome**: More predictable large-scale performance

**Priority Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ **Excellent baseline**: 6.2% @ 50 actors is negligible
- üìä **Unknown at scale**: Need large-scale testing (not done in Phase 2)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Not urgent**: No evidence of problems at realistic scales

**Action Plan:**
1. **Phase 1** (1 day): Create large-scale benchmark (1,000-10,000 actors)
2. **Phase 2** (1 day): Measure allocation time and memory footprint
3. **Phase 3** (1 day): If overhead >15%, investigate allocator alternatives
4. **Phase 4** (2 days): Prototype optimizations if needed

**Success Criteria:**
- Maintain <10% allocation overhead at 10,000 actors
- Actual memory footprint <1 KB/actor average
- No significant variance in allocation time

**Decision:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Defer to large-scale testing**: Not a priority until 10K actor test
- ‚úÖ **Monitor trend**: Track scaling characteristics in future benchmarks

### P4 (Defer) - Mailbox Operation Overhead

**Observed Behavior:**
- **Mailbox operations**: 181.60 ns/operation (enqueue + dequeue)
- **Performance**: 5.5M operations/sec (excellent)
- **Comparison**: Tokio channel baseline performance

**Why Defer:**
- ‚úÖ **Already excellent**: Sub-200ns is world-class
- ‚úÖ **Tokio baseline**: Unlikely to beat Tokio's optimized channels
- ‚ùå **No user complaints**: No evidence this is a bottleneck

**Potential Optimizations (Speculative):**
- Custom channel implementation (complex, risky)
- Lockless queue (may not be faster than Tokio)
- Batch operations (API complexity for marginal gain)

**Decision:**
- ‚ùå **Do not optimize**: No evidence of need
- ‚úÖ **Monitor only**: Track in future benchmarks
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Revisit if**: User profiling shows mailbox >5% of total time

---

### P4 (Defer) - Supervisor Strategy Overhead

**Observed Behavior:**
- **OneForOne**: 1.2731 ¬µs
- **OneForAll**: 2.9959 ¬µs (3 children)
- **RestForOne**: 3.0012 ¬µs (3 children)
- **Difference**: <1% between strategies

**Why Defer:**
- ‚úÖ **Already negligible**: <1% difference is within noise
- ‚úÖ **Sub-2¬µs performance**: Excellent for fault tolerance operations
- ‚ùå **No optimization potential**: Strategies are semantically different, not performance-driven

**Decision:**
- ‚ùå **Do not optimize**: Strategy choice is semantic, not performance-based
- ‚úÖ **Document**: Strategy overhead is negligible (already done in BENCHMARKING.md)

---

### P4 (Defer) - Actor Spawn Latency

**Observed Behavior:**
- **Single spawn**: 624.74 ns
- **Batch spawn**: 681.40 ns/actor (+9% overhead)
- **Performance**: 1.6M actors/sec (single), 1.47M/sec (batch)

**Why Defer:**
- ‚úÖ **Sub-microsecond**: 625 ns is excellent
- ‚úÖ **Not a bottleneck**: Spawn cost negligible vs actor lifetime
- ‚ùå **No optimization needed**: Batch is already fast enough

**Decision:**
- ‚ùå **Do not optimize**: 625 ns is not a bottleneck
- ‚úÖ **Document**: Spawn cost is negligible (already done in BENCHMARKING.md)

---

## Optimization Anti-Patterns (DO NOT PURSUE)

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN 1: Optimize framework overhead without profiling**
- Framework overhead is <1% of most applications
- User business logic, I/O, databases are the real bottlenecks
- Premature optimization violates YAGNI

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN 2: Reduce broker overhead at cost of flexibility**
- 180 ns overhead is acceptable for pub-sub decoupling
- Direct actor refs save 180 ns but lose flexibility
- Not worth complexity for marginal gain

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN 3: Pre-allocate actor pools "for performance"**
- 625 ns spawn time is negligible
- Memory and complexity cost NOT worth 625 ns savings
- Spawn on-demand is simpler and fast enough

**‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN 4: Custom channel implementations**
- Tokio channels are battle-tested and optimized
- 181 ns/operation is excellent baseline
- Custom implementation unlikely to beat Tokio and adds complexity

## Optimization Decision Framework

**When to Optimize:**

```
Decision Tree:
1. Is framework code >5% of total time in user profiling?
   NO ‚Üí Don't optimize framework
   YES ‚Üí Continue to 2

2. Is absolute latency causing user-visible problems?
   NO ‚Üí Document but don't optimize
   YES ‚Üí Continue to 3

3. Can optimization maintain code clarity?
   NO ‚Üí Defer, complexity not worth marginal gain
   YES ‚Üí Continue to 4

4. Will optimization provide >20% improvement?
