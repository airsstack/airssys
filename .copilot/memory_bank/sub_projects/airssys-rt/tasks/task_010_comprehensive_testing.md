# [RT-TASK-010] - Comprehensive Testing

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive testing suite including unit tests, integration tests, property-based testing, stress testing, and continuous integration setup.

## Thought Process
Comprehensive testing ensures runtime reliability through:
1. Complete unit test coverage for all modules
2. Integration testing for component interactions
3. Property-based testing for complex algorithms
4. Stress and load testing for performance validation
5. CI/CD pipeline integration with automated testing
6. Test infrastructure and utilities

This provides confidence in runtime stability and correctness.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Unit Test Completion (Day 1-2)
- Complete unit tests for all 21 modules
- Achieve >95% test coverage
- Add property-based tests with proptest
- Verify all tests pass with zero warnings

### Phase 2: Integration Test Suite (Day 3-4)
- Create comprehensive integration tests in `tests/`
- Test actor lifecycle management
- Test message passing and routing
- Test supervisor tree operations
- Test error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Stress and Load Testing (Day 5-6)
- Implement stress tests for high actor counts
- Add load testing for message throughput
- Test memory usage under load
- Create performance regression tests

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (Day 7)
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- Add automated test execution
- Configure coverage reporting
- Set up performance monitoring

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-02
- Task created with comprehensive testing plan
- Depends on complete runtime implementation
- Architecture designed for comprehensive testability
- Estimated duration: 7 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
- ✅ Unit tests embedded in each module
- ✅ Mockable system dependencies for testing
- ✅ Property-based testing for complex algorithms
- ✅ Integration tests separate from unit tests
- ✅ Proper workspace standards compliance (§2.1-§6.3)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-009 (Complete implementation) - REQUIRED
- **Downstream:** RT-TASK-011 (Documentation completion)
