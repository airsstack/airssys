# [RT-TASK-009] - OSL Integration  

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-11  
**Architecture:** Hierarchical Supervisors with OSL Integration Actors

## Original Request
Integrate airssys-rt with airssys-osl for system-level operations, including process management, security contexts, logging integration, and platform-specific optimizations.

## Architectural Decision (2025-10-11)

**ACCEPTED PATTERN: Hierarchical Supervisor Architecture with OSL Integration Actors**

Based on ADR-RT-007, we implement a service-oriented architecture with dedicated OSL actors:

```
RootSupervisor
├── OSLSupervisor (manages OS integration actors)
│   ├── FileSystemActor (all file/directory operations)
│   ├── ProcessActor (all process spawning/management)
│   └── NetworkActor (all network connections)
└── ApplicationSupervisor (manages business logic actors)
    ├── WorkerActor
    ├── AggregatorActor
    └── CoordinatorActor
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Clean fault isolation (OSL failures don't cascade to app actors)
- Superior testability (mock OSL actors in tests)
- Centralized management (single source of truth for OS operations)
- Service-oriented design (clear service boundaries)
- Process lifecycle safety (automatic cleanup in ProcessActor.stop())

**Related Documentation:**

- **KNOWLEDGE-RT-016**: Process Group Management - Future Considerations (deferred)
- **KNOWLEDGE-RT-017**: OSL Integration Actors Pattern (implementation guide)

## YAGNI Decisions (2025-10-11)

**Deferred Features:**
- ❌ Process group management (setpgid/killpg, Job Objects)
- ❌ Detached process support
- ❌ Complex process lifecycle hooks in supervisors

**Rationale:** Focus on in-memory actors first. Default actor behavior doesn't spawn OS processes. Process group management adds 8-11 days of complexity for unproven use case. Documented in KNOWLEDGE-RT-016 for future implementation when proven necessary.

## Thought Process
OSL integration provides essential system capabilities through dedicated actors:
1. **FileSystemActor** - Centralized file/directory operations with audit logging
2. **ProcessActor** - Process spawning/management with lifecycle tracking
3. **NetworkActor** - Network connections with connection pooling
4. **Security Context** - Propagation from RT actors to OSL operations
5. **Audit Logging** - Centralized in OSL actors for all system operations
6. **Fault Tolerance** - Independent supervisor trees for isolation

This creates a unified runtime that leverages OSL's system capabilities through clean actor-based abstraction.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: OSL Integration Actors (Days 1-4)
**Deliverables:**
- FileSystemActor implementation with message protocol
- ProcessActor implementation with lifecycle tracking
- NetworkActor implementation with connection pooling
- Message protocols for all OSL operations
- Unit tests with mock OSL client

**Files:**
- `src/osl/actors/filesystem.rs` - FileSystemActor
- `src/osl/actors/process.rs` - ProcessActor
- `src/osl/actors/network.rs` - NetworkActor
- `src/osl/actors/messages.rs` - Message protocol definitions
- `tests/osl_actors_tests.rs` - Unit tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All three OSL actors implement Actor + Child traits
- Message-based request-response pattern working
- Mock OSL client used in tests (no real OS operations)
- >95% test coverage for actor logic
- Zero warnings compilation

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Supervisor Setup (Days 5-6)
**Deliverables:**
- OSLSupervisor implementation
- RootSupervisor setup with two branches
- Cross-supervisor communication validation
- Failure isolation tests

**Files:**
- `src/osl/supervisor.rs` - OSLSupervisor setup
- `examples/osl_integration_example.rs` - Complete example
- `tests/supervisor_hierarchy_tests.rs` - Integration tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OSLSupervisor manages all three OSL actors
- ApplicationSupervisor manages example app actors
- RootSupervisor coordinates both supervisors
- Cross-supervisor message passing works seamlessly
- Failure in OSL actor doesn't crash app actors
- Failure in app actor doesn't crash OSL actors

### Phase 3: Security and Audit Integration (Days 7-8)
**Deliverables:**
- Security context propagation in messages
- Audit logging in OSL actors
- Permission validation examples
- Security-focused tests

**Files:**
- `src/osl/security.rs` - Security context types
- `src/osl/actors/audit.rs` - Audit logging utilities
- `tests/security_integration_tests.rs` - Security tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Security context flows from app actors → OSL actors → OSL operations
- All OSL operations logged with actor_id, security_context, operation details
- Permission validation examples documented
- Security tests validate context propagation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Examples (Days 9-10)
**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive examples
- Migration guide from direct OSL helpers
- Performance benchmarks
- mdBook documentation chapter

**Files:**
- `examples/filesystem_actor_usage.rs`
- `examples/process_actor_usage.rs`
- `examples/network_actor_usage.rs`
- `examples/supervisor_hierarchy_complete.rs`
- `docs/src/osl_integration.md` - mdBook chapter

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 4+ working examples demonstrating patterns
- Migration guide helps developers transition from direct helpers
- Performance benchmarks show <1% message passing overhead
- mdBook chapter explains architecture and usage
