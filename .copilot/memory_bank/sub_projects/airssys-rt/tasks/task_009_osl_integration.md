# [RT-TASK-009] - OSL Integration  

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Integrate airssys-rt with airssys-osl for system-level operations, including process management, security contexts, logging integration, and platform-specific optimizations.

## Thought Process
OSL integration provides essential system capabilities:
1. Process management through OSL abstractions
2. Security context integration for actor operations
3. Seamless logging through OSL framework
4. Platform-specific runtime optimizations
5. Resource management and monitoring
6. System-level security enforcement

This creates a unified runtime that leverages OSL's system capabilities.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Core OSL Integration (Day 1-2)
- Add airssys-osl dependency to Cargo.toml
- Integrate OSL security contexts in actor operations
- Add process management through OSL abstractions
- Create integration unit tests

### Phase 2: Logging Integration (Day 3)
- Integrate OSL logging framework
- Add structured logging for actor operations
- Implement audit trails for system operations
- Create logging unit tests

### Phase 3: Security Context Integration (Day 4)
- Add security context propagation in messages
- Implement permission-based actor operations
- Add security validation in supervisor trees
- Create security-focused unit tests

### Phase 4: Platform Optimizations (Day 5)
- Add platform-specific runtime optimizations
- Integrate OSL performance monitoring
- Implement resource usage tracking
- Create platform-specific tests
