# [RT-TASK-009] - OSL Integration  

**Status:** in-progress (Phase 1: 80% complete - 4/5 subtasks done)  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Architecture:** Hierarchical Supervisors with OSL Integration Actors

## Original Request
Integrate airssys-rt with airssys-osl for system-level operations, including process management, security contexts, logging integration, and platform-specific optimizations.

## Architectural Decision (2025-10-11)

**ACCEPTED PATTERN: Hierarchical Supervisor Architecture with OSL Integration Actors**

Based on ADR-RT-007, we implement a service-oriented architecture with dedicated OSL actors:

```
RootSupervisor
├── OSLSupervisor (manages OS integration actors)
│   ├── FileSystemActor (all file/directory operations)
│   ├── ProcessActor (all process spawning/management)
│   └── NetworkActor (all network connections)
└── ApplicationSupervisor (manages business logic actors)
    ├── WorkerActor
    ├── AggregatorActor
    └── CoordinatorActor
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Clean fault isolation (OSL failures don't cascade to app actors)
- Superior testability (mock OSL actors in tests)
- Centralized management (single source of truth for OS operations)
- Service-oriented design (clear service boundaries)
- Process lifecycle safety (automatic cleanup in ProcessActor.stop())

- **KNOWLEDGE-RT-016**: Process Group Management - Future Considerations (deferred)
- **KNOWLEDGE-RT-017**: OSL Integration Actors Pattern (needs update for wrapper pattern)

## YAGNI Decisions (2025-10-11)

**Deferred Features:**
- ❌ Process group management (setpgid/killpg, Job Objects)
- ❌ Detached process support
- ❌ Complex process lifecycle hooks in supervisors

**Rationale:** Focus on in-memory actors first. Default actor behavior doesn't spawn OS processes. Process group management adds 8-11 days of complexity for unproven use case. Documented in KNOWLEDGE-RT-016 for future implementation when proven necessary.

## Thought Process
OSL integration provides essential system capabilities through dedicated actors:
1. **FileSystemActor** - Centralized file/directory operations with audit logging
2. **ProcessActor** - Process spawning/management with lifecycle tracking
3. **NetworkActor** - Network connections with connection pooling
4. **Security Context** - Propagation from RT actors to OSL operations
5. **Audit Logging** - Centralized in OSL actors for all system operations
6. **Fault Tolerance** - Independent supervisor trees for isolation

This creates a unified runtime that leverages OSL's system capabilities through clean actor-based abstraction.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: OSL Integration Actors (Days 1-4) - 80% COMPLETE ✅
**Status:** 4/5 subtasks complete (Phase 1A-1D done, Phase 1E pending)

**Completed (2025-10-14):**
- ✅ **Phase 1A**: Module structure created (`src/osl/mod.rs`, actor files)
- ✅ **Phase 1B**: Message protocol with ADR-RT-008 wrapper pattern
  - Three-layer design: *Operation, *Request, *Response
  - All message types cloneable (Clone + Serialize + Deserialize)
  - MessageId-based correlation for request-response matching
- ✅ **Phase 1C**: Actor implementations refactored
  - FileSystemActor, ProcessActor, NetworkActor with execute_operation()
  - Actor trait: handle_message() implementation
  - Child trait: start(), stop(Duration), health_check() implementation
  - Removed all oneshot channel dependencies
- ✅ **Phase 1D**: Compilation & quality validation
  - Zero compilation errors, zero warnings, zero clippy warnings
  - 17/17 embedded tests passing
  - Modern Rust idioms (inline format args, thiserror, #[async_trait])

**Remaining:**
- ⏳ **Phase 1E**: Integration tests in `tests/osl_actors_tests.rs`
  - Comprehensive unit tests with mock broker
  - Test request-response flow and message correlation
  - Target: >95% test coverage for actor logic

**Files (Completed):**
- ✅ `src/osl/mod.rs` - Module exports (88 lines)
- ✅ `src/osl/actors/filesystem.rs` - FileSystemActor (406 lines, 7 tests)
- ✅ `src/osl/actors/process.rs` - ProcessActor (372 lines, 5 tests)
- ✅ `src/osl/actors/network.rs` - NetworkActor (329 lines, 5 tests)
- ✅ `src/osl/actors/messages.rs` - Message protocols (332 lines, 2 tests)
- ⏳ `tests/osl_actors_tests.rs` - Integration tests (pending)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All three OSL actors implement Actor + Child traits
- ✅ Message-based request-response pattern implemented (ADR-RT-008)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OSLSupervisor manages all three OSL actors
- ApplicationSupervisor manages example app actors
- RootSupervisor coordinates both supervisors
- Cross-supervisor message passing works seamlessly
- Failure in OSL actor doesn't crash app actors
- Failure in app actor doesn't crash OSL actors

### Phase 3: Security and Audit Integration (Days 7-8)
