# [RT-TASK-002] - Actor System Core

**Status:** in_progress  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-04

## Original Request
Implement the core actor system with generic Actor trait, ActorContext, and lifecycle management. This includes the fundamental actor programming model with zero-cost abstractions.

## Thought Process
The actor system core builds on the message system foundation to provide:
1. Generic Actor trait with compile-time type safety
2. ActorContext<M: Message> with no trait objects
3. Actor lifecycle management (pre_start, post_stop, on_error)
4. ErrorAction enum for supervision decisions
5. Generic constraints throughout for maximum performance
6. Foundation for all actor-based applications

This establishes the core programming model that developers will use to build actors.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Actor Trait Definition (Day 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE
- Implement `src/actor/traits.rs` with generic Actor trait ✅
- Add ErrorAction enum for supervision ✅
- Define lifecycle methods (pre_start, post_stop, on_error) ✅
- Create comprehensive unit tests ✅

### Phase 2: Actor Context (Day 3-4) ⏳ NEXT
- Implement `src/actor/context.rs` with ActorContext<M>
- Add message sending methods (send_to, request, reply)
- Implement actor ID and address accessors
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Lifecycle Management (Day 5) ⏳ PENDING
- Implement `src/actor/lifecycle.rs` with actor state management
- Add actor startup and shutdown procedures
- Implement error handling integration
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 4: Module Integration (Day 6) ⏳ PENDING
- Set up `src/actor/mod.rs` with proper exports ✅
- Ensure all modules compile and tests pass
- Update `src/lib.rs` with public API exports ✅
- Create integration examples

- Added helper methods: is_terminal(), is_running()
- Added 10 comprehensive unit tests for lifecycle
- 56/56 tests passing, zero warnings
- **Phase 2 Complete**: ActorContext fully implemented

- 46/46 tests passing, zero warnings
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Actor trait and ErrorAction enum fully implemented
- Created `src/actor/traits.rs` (690 lines) with comprehensive rustdoc
- Created `src/actor/context.rs` (placeholder, ready for Phase 2)
- Created `src/actor/mod.rs` (§4.3 compliant)
- Updated `src/lib.rs` with public API exports

### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on RT-TASK-001 Message System completion
- Architecture design finalized with generic constraints
- Estimated duration: 5-6 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
