# [RT-TASK-008] - Performance Features

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-04

## Original Request
Implement core performance optimization features including message routing optimization and actor pool load balancing enhancements.

**Revised:** 2025-10-04 - Removed metrics collection and performance monitoring (deferred to future iterations)

## Thought Process
Performance features enhance the runtime with:
1. Message routing optimization for high throughput
2. Advanced load balancing algorithms
3. Benchmarking and performance testing

This ensures the runtime can handle production workloads efficiently. Metrics collection and monitoring are deferred to allow focus on core optimization work.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Message Routing Optimization (Day 1-2)
- Optimize message delivery paths
- Add message batching for high throughput
- Implement routing caches and optimizations
- Create performance unit tests

### Phase 2: Load Balancing Enhancement (Day 3-4)
- Enhance actor pool load balancing
- Add advanced strategies (WeightedRoundRobin, etc.)
- Implement health-aware routing
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Performance Testing (Day 5)
- Create performance benchmarks in `benches/`
- Add throughput and latency tests
- Document performance characteristics

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-04
- **Task scope revised**: Removed metrics collection and performance monitoring
- Focus narrowed to core optimization: routing and load balancing
- Subtasks reduced from 10 to 7 items
- Estimated duration reduced from 5-7 days to 3-5 days

### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on core runtime stability (RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-007)
- Architecture design optimized for zero-cost abstractions

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
- ✅ No `Box<dyn Trait>` usage planned
- ✅ Zero-cost optimization techniques
- ✅ Compile-time performance optimizations
- ✅ Embedded unit tests planned for each module
- ✅ Proper workspace standards compliance (§2.1-§6.3)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-007 (Stable runtime) - REQUIRED
- **Downstream:** RT-TASK-010 (Testing), RT-TASK-011 (Documentation)
