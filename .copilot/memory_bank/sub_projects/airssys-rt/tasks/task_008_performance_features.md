# [RT-TASK-008] - Performance Features

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Implement performance optimization features including message routing optimization, actor pool load balancing, metrics collection, and monitoring integration.

## Thought Process
Performance features enhance the runtime with:
1. Message routing optimization for high throughput
2. Advanced load balancing algorithms
3. Comprehensive metrics collection system
4. Performance monitoring and observability
5. Benchmarking and performance testing
6. Integration with external monitoring systems

This ensures the runtime can handle production workloads efficiently.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Message Routing Optimization (Day 1-2)
- Optimize message delivery paths
- Add message batching for high throughput
- Implement routing caches and optimizations
- Create performance unit tests

### Phase 2: Load Balancing Enhancement (Day 3-4)
- Enhance actor pool load balancing
- Add advanced strategies (WeightedRoundRobin, etc.)
- Implement health-aware routing
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Metrics Collection (Day 5-6)
- Implement `src/util/metrics.rs` with metrics collection
- Add message throughput, latency, and error metrics
- Integrate with tracing for observability
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 4: Performance Testing (Day 7)
- Create performance benchmarks in `benches/`
- Add throughput and latency tests
- Implement performance regression detection
- Document performance characteristics

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on core runtime stability (RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-007)
- Architecture design optimized for zero-cost abstractions
- Estimated duration: 5-7 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
