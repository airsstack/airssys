# [RT-TASK-008] - Performance Baseline Measurement

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Original Request
Implement core performance optimization features including message routing optimization and actor pool load balancing enhancements.

**Revised (2025-10-04):** Removed metrics collection and performance monitoring (deferred to future iterations)

**Revised (2025-10-15):** **MAJOR SCOPE CHANGE** - Focus shifted from premature optimization to baseline measurement
- **Old Approach**: Implement optimizations without data (speculative performance targets like "10k concurrent actors")
- **New Approach**: Establish baseline performance metrics of current architecture for data-driven future optimization
- **Rationale**: YAGNI compliance - measure first, optimize later based on actual data and real-world requirements

## Thought Process
**Data-Driven Performance Strategy:**

Instead of premature optimization, we need to:
1. **Measure Current Performance**: Establish baseline metrics for the existing architecture
2. **Document Characteristics**: Understand current throughput, latency, resource usage patterns
3. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use data to find actual performance constraints (not assumed ones)
4. **Establish Baselines**: Create benchmarks that can track performance across changes
5. **Enable Future Optimization**: Provide data foundation for informed optimization decisions

**Key Principle**: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth
- Current implementation is already designed with zero-cost abstractions
- No performance issues reported or proven
- Optimization should be driven by real data, not speculation

## Implementation Plan

## Notes

### Why Baseline-First Approach?

**Advantages**:
1. **Data-Driven**: Optimization decisions based on real measurements, not assumptions
2. **YAGNI Compliance**: Don't optimize what doesn't need optimizing
3. **Transparency**: Users know actual performance characteristics
4. **Regression Detection**: Catch performance degradation early
5. **Informed Decisions**: Future work prioritized by impact potential

**Prevents**:
1. ❌ Premature optimization (solving non-existent problems)
2. ❌ Speculative performance targets (10k actors without proof)
3. ❌ Wasted effort on micro-optimizations with negligible impact
4. ❌ Architecture changes without justification

### Current Architecture Performance Expectations

The runtime is already designed with zero-cost abstractions:
- Generic constraints (no `Box<dyn Trait>`)
- Static dispatch (compile-time resolution)
- Minimal allocations (Arc-based sharing)
- Async/await with Tokio (efficient concurrency)

**Expected Results**: Current implementation should already perform well. Baseline will either:
- ✅ Confirm zero-cost abstraction effectiveness
- ⚠️ Reveal unexpected bottlenecks requiring investigation

### Future Optimization Strategy

**If baseline reveals bottlenecks**:
1. Identify root cause with profiling (flamegraph, perf)
2. Create focused optimization task with clear goals
3. Implement optimization with benchmark validation
4. Measure impact against baseline
5. Document performance improvement

**If baseline shows good performance**:
1. Document current characteristics
2. Defer optimization until real-world usage reveals needs
3. Focus on other project priorities (documentation, features)
4. Maintain baseline tracking to prevent regressions
