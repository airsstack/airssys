# [RT-TASK-006] - Actor System Framework

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Implement the main actor system framework with ActorSystem, ActorSpawnBuilder using Builder Pattern, and system configuration management.

## Thought Process
The actor system framework provides the high-level API for:
1. ActorSystem<B: MessageBroker> with pluggable message brokers
2. ActorSpawnBuilder with flexible Builder Pattern configuration
3. SystemConfig for system-wide configuration
4. Actor lifecycle management and coordination
5. Integration of all core components into cohesive system
6. Simple developer API hiding infrastructure complexity

This provides the main entry point and user-facing API for the runtime.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: System Configuration (Day 1)
- Implement `src/system/config.rs` with SystemConfig
- Add configuration validation and defaults
- Implement configuration serialization
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 2: Actor Spawn Builder (Day 2-3)
- Implement `src/system/builder.rs` with ActorSpawnBuilder
- Add Builder Pattern with fluent API
- Implement supervisor assignment and configuration
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Actor System Core (Day 4-5)
- Implement `src/system/actor_system.rs` with ActorSystem<B>
- Add actor spawning and lifecycle management
- Implement system shutdown and cleanup
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 4: Error Types and Integration (Day 6)
- Implement `src/system/errors.rs` with SystemError
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Integrate all system components
- Create integration examples

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on all foundational components (RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-005)
- Architecture design finalized with generic constraints
- Estimated duration: 5-6 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
- ✅ No `Box<dyn Trait>` usage planned
- ✅ Generic ActorSystem<B: MessageBroker>
- ✅ Builder Pattern with compile-time configuration
- ✅ Proper error handling with thiserror
- ✅ Embedded unit tests planned for each module
- ✅ Proper workspace standards compliance (§2.1-§6.3)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-005 (All foundation components) - REQUIRED
- **Downstream:** RT-TASK-007 (Supervisor Framework), RT-TASK-009 (OSL Integration)
