# [RT-TASK-005] - Actor Addressing

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Implement the actor addressing system with ActorAddress types, address resolution, and actor pool management for load balancing and service discovery.

## Thought Process
The addressing system provides flexible actor targeting with:
1. ActorAddress enum with Id, Named, Service, Pool variants
2. PoolStrategy enum for load balancing algorithms
3. Address resolution logic for all address types
4. Actor pool management with various strategies
5. Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time routing
6. Integration with message broker for efficient delivery

This enables flexible actor communication patterns and scalable deployment.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Address Types (Day 1)
- Implement `src/address/types.rs` with ActorAddress enum
- Add PoolStrategy enum with all variants
- Implement serialization and equality traits
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 2: Address Resolution (Day 2)
- Implement `src/address/resolver.rs` with AddressResolver
- Add resolution logic for all address types
- Implement caching for performance
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Actor Pool Management (Day 3-4)
- Implement `src/address/pool.rs` with ActorPool
- Add load balancing strategies (RoundRobin, LeastConnections, etc.)
- Implement pool health monitoring
- Create comprehensive unit tests

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on RT-TASK-001 Message System completion
- Architecture design finalized with zero-cost abstractions
- Estimated duration: 3-4 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
