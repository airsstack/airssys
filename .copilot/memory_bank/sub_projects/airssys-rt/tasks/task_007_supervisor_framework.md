# [RT-TASK-007] - Supervisor Framework

**Status:** complete  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Completed:** 2025-10-08  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core fault tolerance component  
**Dependencies:** RT-TASK-010 (Monitoring Module) - COMPLETE

## Original Request
Implement the complete supervisor framework with supervisor traits, supervisor tree management, restart strategies, and health monitoring for fault tolerance.

## Thought Process
The supervisor framework provides fault tolerance through:
1. Supervisor trait for hierarchical supervision
2. SupervisorNode<S, C, M> with generic strategy, child, and monitor types
3. RestartStrategy enum (OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne)
4. Actor health monitoring and failure detection
5. Automatic restart and recovery mechanisms
6. Integration with RT-TASK-010 monitoring module via Monitor<SupervisionEvent>
7. Integration with actor system for seamless operation

This implements the core fault tolerance patterns from BEAM/OTP with Rust type safety.

**Task Sequencing Decision (Oct 6, 2025):**
- RT-TASK-010 (Monitoring Module) must be completed FIRST
- Provides Monitor<SupervisionEvent> for supervisor health tracking
- Reduces RT-TASK-007 complexity by using existing monitoring infrastructure
- Estimated duration reduced from 10-12 days to 8-10 days

**Detailed Action Plans:**
- See `docs/knowledges/knowledge_rt_013_task_007_010_action_plans.md` for comprehensive implementation plan

## Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT:** Complete RT-TASK-010 (Monitoring Module) before starting this task.

### Phase 1: Supervisor Traits & Core Types (Day 1-2 - 12-16 hours)
- Implement `src/supervisor/mod.rs` with module declarations
- Implement `src/supervisor/traits.rs` with Supervisor, Child, SupervisionStrategy traits
- Implement `src/supervisor/types.rs` with ChildSpec, RestartPolicy, ShutdownPolicy types  
- Implement `src/supervisor/error.rs` with SupervisorError
- Create comprehensive unit tests (~20 tests)

**Integration with RT-TASK-010:**
- SupervisorNode<S, C, M> uses M: Monitor<SupervisionEvent>
- All supervision events recorded via monitor.record()

### Phase 2: Restart Strategies (Day 3-4 - 12-16 hours)
- Implement `src/supervisor/strategy.rs` with restart strategies
- Add OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne implementations
- Implement `src/supervisor/backoff.rs` with restart counting and exponential backoff
- Create comprehensive unit tests (~25 tests)

### Phase 3: Supervisor Tree & Node Management (Day 5-7 - 18-24 hours)
- Implement `src/supervisor/node.rs` with SupervisorNode<S, C, M>
- Implement `src/supervisor/tree.rs` with SupervisorTree hierarchy
- Add hierarchical supervision management
- Implement child actor lifecycle coordination
- Create comprehensive unit tests (~30 tests)

### Phase 4: Health Monitoring & Restart Logic (Day 8-10 - 18-24 hours)
- Implement `src/supervisor/health.rs` with health monitoring
- Add failure detection and reporting
- Implement restart decision logic
- Background health check tasks
- Create comprehensive unit tests (~20 tests)

### Phase 5: Integration & Examples (Simplified - 4-6 hours)
- Create `examples/supervisor_basic.rs` - Basic supervisor usage
- Create `examples/supervisor_strategies.rs` - Strategy comparison
- Integration tests in `tests/supervisor_tests.rs` (~15 tests)
- Documentation updates

**Note:** Phase 5 simplified because monitoring infrastructure already exists from RT-TASK-010
