# [RT-TASK-007] - Supervisor Framework

**Status:** pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-02

## Original Request
Implement the complete supervisor framework with supervisor traits, supervisor tree management, restart strategies, and health monitoring for fault tolerance.

## Thought Process
The supervisor framework provides fault tolerance through:
1. Supervisor trait for hierarchical supervision
2. SupervisorTree for organizing supervision hierarchy
3. RestartStrategy enum (OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne)
4. Actor health monitoring and failure detection
5. Automatic restart and recovery mechanisms
6. Integration with actor system for seamless operation

This implements the core fault tolerance patterns from BEAM/OTP.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Supervisor Traits (Day 1-2)
- Implement `src/supervisor/traits.rs` with Supervisor trait
- Add SupervisorStrategy and RestartPolicy enums
- Define supervisor error types
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 2: Restart Strategies (Day 3-4)
- Implement `src/supervisor/strategy.rs` with restart strategies
- Add OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne implementations
- Implement restart counting and backoff
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Supervisor Tree (Day 5-7)
- Implement `src/supervisor/tree.rs` with SupervisorTree
- Add hierarchical supervision management
- Implement child actor management
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 4: Health Monitoring (Day 8-10)
- Implement `src/supervisor/monitor.rs` with health monitoring
- Add failure detection and reporting
- Implement restart decision logic
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 5: Integration (Day 11-12)
- Integrate supervisor with actor system
- Add supervisor configuration in ActorSpawnBuilder
- Test complete supervision scenarios
- Create integration examples

## Progress Log
### 2025-10-02
- Task created with detailed implementation plan
- Depends on complete actor system foundation (RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-006)
- Architecture design finalized with BEAM-inspired patterns
- Estimated duration: 10-12 days

## Architecture Compliance Checklist
- ✅ No `Box<dyn Trait>` usage planned
- ✅ Generic supervisor traits with type safety
- ✅ BEAM-inspired supervision patterns
- ✅ Embedded unit tests planned for each module
- ✅ Proper workspace standards compliance (§2.1-§6.3)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream:** RT-TASK-001 through RT-TASK-006 (Complete foundation) - REQUIRED
- **Downstream:** RT-TASK-009 (OSL Integration), RT-TASK-010 (Testing)
