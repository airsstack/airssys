# [RT-TASK-001] - Message System Implementation

**Status:** completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-02  
**Updated:** 2025-10-04  
**Completed:** 2025-10-04

## Original Request
Implement the core message system with zero-cost abstractions, including Message trait, MessageEnvelope, MessagePriority, and utility types for ActorId and MessageId generation.

## Thought Process
The message system is the foundation of the entire actor runtime. It must implement:
1. Zero-reflection Message trait with const MESSAGE_TYPE
2. Generic MessageEnvelope with no type erasure
3. MessagePriority enum for routing
4. ActorId and MessageId generation utilities
5. Full type safety with compile-time verification
6. Embedded unit tests for all components

This forms the type-safe foundation that all other components depend on.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ Update Cargo.toml with required dependencies
- ✅ Verify workspace dependency compliance
- ✅ Ensure zero warnings compilation
- ✅ All dependencies use workspace versions (§5.1)

### Phase 2: Core Message Trait (IN PROGRESS - Day 1)
- Implement `src/message/traits.rs` with Message trait
- Add MessagePriority enum with ordering
- Create comprehensive unit tests
- Ensure const MESSAGE_TYPE works correctly

### Phase 3: Message Envelope (Day 2)
- Implement `src/message/envelope.rs` with generic MessageEnvelope<M>
- Add builder pattern methods (with_sender, with_reply_to, etc.)
- Implement TTL and expiration logic
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Utility Types (Day 3)
- Implement `src/util/ids.rs` with ActorId and MessageId
- Add UUID generation and serialization
- Implement Display and Default traits
- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 4: Module Integration (Day 4)
- Set up `src/message/mod.rs` with proper exports
- Set up `src/util/mod.rs` with proper exports
- Ensure all modules compile and tests pass
- Update `src/lib.rs` with public API exports

## Progress Tracking
