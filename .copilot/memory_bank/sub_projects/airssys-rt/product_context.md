# airssys-rt Product Context

## Problem Statement
Modern system programming often requires managing many concurrent operations, but traditional threading models are resource-intensive and error-prone. The Erlang-Actor model provides excellent concurrency but BEAM is heavy for system programming contexts.

## Why airssys-rt Exists
`airssys-rt` brings the proven Erlang-Actor model benefits to system programming with a lightweight implementation optimized for the AirsSys ecosystem's needs.

## Target Use Cases

### High-Concurrency System Services
- Network services managing thousands of connections
- File system monitors handling many simultaneous events
- Process managers coordinating multiple system operations
- Event processing systems with complex workflow requirements

### Fault-Tolerant System Components
- Critical system services requiring automatic recovery
- Distributed system components needing supervision
- Long-running system processes with error isolation
- Components requiring graceful degradation under load

### AirsSys Ecosystem Integration
- Actor-based process management for airssys-osl operations
- Supervision of airssys-wasm component lifecycles
- Coordination between different AirsSys subsystems
- Event-driven architecture for system monitoring

## User Experience Goals

### Developer Experience
- **Familiar Actor Model**: Easy transition for Erlang/Elixir developers
- **Rust Integration**: Native Rust async/await integration
- **Simple APIs**: Intuitive actor creation and message sending
- **Rich Debugging**: Comprehensive actor state inspection and monitoring

### Operations Experience
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from actor failures
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into actor system health
- **Performance**: Predictable performance under varying loads
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory and CPU utilization

## Value Proposition

### For System Developers
- **Simplified Concurrency**: Actor model eliminates complex synchronization
- **Fault Isolation**: Actor failures don't cascade to entire system
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to scale from hundreds to thousands of actors
- **Integration Ready**: Designed for integration with airssys-osl and airssys-wasm

### For AirsSys Ecosystem
- **Process Coordination**: Central coordination point for all AirsSys components
- **Fault Management**: Unified fault handling across the ecosystem
- **Event Processing**: Event-driven architecture foundation
- **Resource Orchestration**: Intelligent resource management and allocation
