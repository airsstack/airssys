# airssys-rt Active Context

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Planning and Architecture Design  
**Status:** Pending - Waiting for airssys-osl foundation  
**Priority:** High - Core runtime component for AirsSys ecosystem

## Recent Changes
### 2025-09-27
- **Memory Bank Established**: Complete memory bank structure created
- **Project Scope Defined**: Clear boundaries and integration points established
- **Actor Model Research**: Analyzed BEAM principles for lightweight implementation
- **Performance Targets Set**: Defined specific performance and scalability goals

## Current Work Items
1. **Architecture Definition**: Design actor model implementation details
2. **Integration Planning**: Define integration patterns with airssys-osl
3. **Message Passing Design**: Design efficient message passing system
4. **Supervisor Tree Architecture**: Plan fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish remaining core files
2. **Technology Selection ADR**: Document core technology and architecture decisions
3. **Actor Lifecycle Design**: Define actor creation, execution, and termination
4. **Message Protocol Design**: Define message format and routing mechanisms

## Decisions Made
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Not replacing BEAM but creating focused actor model
- **Tokio Integration**: Use Tokio async runtime for underlying execution
- **Zero-Copy Goals**: Minimize message copying for performance
- **AirsSys Integration**: Tight integration with airssys-osl for system operations

## Pending Decisions
- **Actor Storage Strategy**: How to efficiently store and manage actor state
- **Message Queue Implementation**: Specific mailbox implementation approach
- **Supervisor Strategy**: Default supervision strategies and configuration
- **Distribution Strategy**: Future distributed actor communication approach

## Dependencies
- **airssys-osl Foundation**: Requires basic airssys-osl implementation for OS integration
- **Technology Decisions**: Waiting for core technology stack finalization
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Needs performance testing infrastructure

## Context for Next Session
- Memory bank structure complete and ready for detailed design
- Actor model principles researched and requirements defined
- Integration points with airssys-osl and airssys-wasm identified
- Ready to begin concrete architecture and implementation planning

## Insights
- Actor model provides excellent fault isolation for system programming
- Message passing can significantly reduce synchronization complexity
- Supervisor trees are crucial for system-level fault tolerance
- Integration with airssys-osl will enable powerful system programming patterns

## Momentum Indicators
- âœ… Project structure and scope clearly defined
- âœ… Actor model principles and requirements understood
- âœ… Integration strategy with other AirsSys components planned
- ðŸ”„ Ready for detailed architecture and technology selection
