  - Required: Actor system foundation for component hosting

### CURRENT PHASE: Research and Planning ⏳
- **Architecture Research**: WASM runtime selection and component model analysis
- **Security Design**: Capability-based security and sandboxing architecture
- **Integration Planning**: Deep integration patterns with AirsSys components
- **Technology Evaluation**: WebAssembly Component Model tooling assessment

### PLANNED WORK (When Dependencies Ready - Q3 2026+)

  - Basic WASM component loading and execution
  - WebAssembly Component Model implementation
  - Security sandbox with capability-based access control
  - WASI Preview 2 integration

#### Phase 2: AirsSys Ecosystem Integration  
- **WASM-TASK-002**: Host Integration Layer (Priority 2, 2-3 weeks)
  - airssys-osl bridge for secure system access
  - airssys-rt integration for actor-based hosting
  - Custom host functions for AirsSys ecosystem
  - Resource management and monitoring

#### Phase 3: Component Management System
- **WASM-TASK-003**: Component Registry (Priority 3, 1-2 weeks)
  - Component discovery and lifecycle management
  - Inter-component communication framework
  - Performance optimization and monitoring
  - Hot-reloading and dynamic updates  
  - Architecture validation: Tests middleware trait design with real implementation
  - Foundation: Provides concrete middleware for framework integration

- **OSL-TASK-005**: API Ergonomics Foundation (High, 4-6 hours) - AFTER 002
  - Quick foundation setup maintaining development momentum
  - Framework design informed by logger middleware implementation
  - Infrastructure for builder patterns and ergonomic APIs
  - Integration showcase using logger middleware

- **OSL-TASK-006**: Core Builder Implementation (High, 8-10 hours) - AFTER 005  
  - Complete OSLFramework builder with working logger middleware
  - Major UX improvement: ergonomic APIs with functional middleware
  - Comprehensive testing platform for future middleware
  - Full developer experience with both explicit and builder APIs

- **OSL-TASK-003**: Security Middleware Module (High, 2-3 days) - AFTER 006
  - Complex implementation benefits from mature framework platform
  - Can use logger + framework infrastructure for development/testing
  - Complete integration into established patterns and APIs
  - Enterprise-ready security on proven foundation

## Technical Standards Compliance

### Updated Standards Integration (Completed)
- ✅ §6.1: YAGNI Principles - build only what's needed
- ✅ §6.2: Avoid dyn patterns - prefer generic constraints
- ✅ §6.3: Microsoft Rust Guidelines - production-quality standards
- ✅ §7.1: mdBook Documentation Standards - comprehensive technical documentation
- ✅ §7.2: Documentation Quality Standards - professional, factual, assumption-free documentation
- ✅ AGENTS.md updated with complete standards reference

### Architecture Decisions (Completed)
- ✅ Generic-first design pattern (no dyn except where absolutely necessary)
- ✅ Core-first module architecture with priority implementation
- ✅ Security consolidated in middleware/security/ module
- ✅ Simplified error handling with structured error types
