# Current Context

**Active Sub-Project:** airssys-osl  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-29  
**Context Switch Reason:** OSL-TASK-001 completed with code quality improvements, shifting to API ergonomics development

## Quick Context Summary
- **Workspace**: AirsSys system programming components for AirsStack ecosystem
- **Active Focus**: Hybrid development strategy - concrete middleware → ergonomic framework → advanced features
- **Recent Achievement**: Complete core foundation with explicit imports, clean API design, 41 tests passing
- **Next Priority**: OSL-TASK-002 Logger Middleware - provides immediate value + framework development support
- **Strategy**: Concrete functionality first, then ergonomic APIs, then advanced security features
- **Key Decision**: Prioritize user value and development efficiency through strategic sequencing

## Recent Progress
- ✅ Memory bank setup and documentation framework completed
- ✅ Technical standards updated with YAGNI, avoid-dyn, Microsoft Guidelines integration  
- ✅ Core architecture knowledge documented (001-core-architecture-foundations.md)
- ✅ OSL-TASK-001 COMPLETED - Complete core foundation with production-ready quality
- ✅ **NEW**: Clean API design with explicit imports (no convenience re-exports)
- ✅ **NEW**: Import consistency across all modules (no FQN patterns)
- ✅ **NEW**: Comprehensive documentation with clear module responsibilities
- ✅ **NEW**: 41 passing tests (28 unit + 9 integration + 4 doc tests)
- ✅ **NEW**: Full workspace standards compliance (§2.1-§6.3)
- ✅ **NEW**: API ergonomics analysis completed (004-api-ergonomics-architecture.md)
- ✅ **NEW**: Optimal task prioritization strategy established (002 → 005 → 006 → 003)
- ✅ **NEW**: Strategic rationale: concrete value → foundation → framework → advanced features

## Available Sub-Projects
1. **airssys-osl** (Active) - OS Layer Framework for low-level system programming
2. **airssys-rt** - Erlang-Actor model runtime system
3. **airssys-wasm** - WebAssembly pluggable system for secure component execution

## Current Implementation Status

### COMPLETED: Core Foundation ✅
- **OSL-TASK-001**: Core Module Foundation (FULLY COMPLETED - Production Ready)
  - Status: **All 4 Phases Complete + Code Quality Improvements** ✅
  - Achievement: Production-ready foundation with 41 passing tests (28 unit + 9 integration + 4 doc tests)
  - Quality: Zero warnings, comprehensive documentation, clean explicit API design
  - Architecture: Generic-based traits, sophisticated error handling, complete lifecycle management
  - Standards: Full compliance with workspace standards (§2.1-§6.3) and Microsoft Guidelines

### NEW PRIORITY: Hybrid Development Strategy (Concrete → Foundation → Advanced)
- **OSL-TASK-002**: Logger Middleware Module (Critical, 1-2 days) - NEXT TASK
  - Immediate value: Comprehensive activity logging for all operations
  - Development support: Critical debugging/monitoring for framework development  
  - Architecture validation: Tests middleware trait design with real implementation
  - Foundation: Provides concrete middleware for framework integration

- **OSL-TASK-005**: API Ergonomics Foundation (High, 4-6 hours) - AFTER 002
  - Quick foundation setup maintaining development momentum
  - Framework design informed by logger middleware implementation
  - Infrastructure for builder patterns and ergonomic APIs
  - Integration showcase using logger middleware

- **OSL-TASK-006**: Core Builder Implementation (High, 8-10 hours) - AFTER 005  
  - Complete OSLFramework builder with working logger middleware
  - Major UX improvement: ergonomic APIs with functional middleware
  - Comprehensive testing platform for future middleware
  - Full developer experience with both explicit and builder APIs

- **OSL-TASK-003**: Security Middleware Module (High, 2-3 days) - AFTER 006
  - Complex implementation benefits from mature framework platform
  - Can use logger + framework infrastructure for development/testing
  - Complete integration into established patterns and APIs
  - Enterprise-ready security on proven foundation

## Technical Standards Compliance

### Updated Standards Integration (Completed)
- ✅ §6.1: YAGNI Principles - build only what's needed
- ✅ §6.2: Avoid dyn patterns - prefer generic constraints
- ✅ §6.3: Microsoft Rust Guidelines - production-quality standards
- ✅ §7.1: mdBook Documentation Standards - comprehensive technical documentation
- ✅ §7.2: Documentation Quality Standards - professional, factual, assumption-free documentation
- ✅ AGENTS.md updated with complete standards reference

### Architecture Decisions (Completed)
- ✅ Generic-first design pattern (no dyn except where absolutely necessary)
- ✅ Core-first module architecture with priority implementation
- ✅ Security consolidated in middleware/security/ module
- ✅ Simplified error handling with structured error types
